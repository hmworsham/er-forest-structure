### Use iDetrend first to determine most appropriate detrending option, then apply detrending option for entire site.
# This you will need to interact with R for each series after viewing plots/options.

                   pos.slope = FALSE)

### If you want to detrend a single series then use the code below.
singleseries<-MySite[, "MySite01A"]
names(singleseries)<-rownames(MySite)
singleseries.rwi<-detrend.singleseries(y = singleseries, y.name = "MySite01A", verbose = TRUE)

### Site-level detrend. Detrend method options are "Spline", "ModNegExp","Mean", "Ar", "Friedman", "ModHugershoff"
MySite.rwi <- detrend(rwl = MySite, method = "ModNegExp")
rwl.stats(MySite)

# The function read.ids is used to identify which trees have multiple cores.
MySite.ids <- read.ids(MySite, stc = c(3,2,3))
stats <- rwi.stats(MySite.rwi, MySite.ids, prewhiten=TRUE)

# Interseries correlation gives average interseries correlation (different than rbar)
MySite.rho <- interseries.cor(MySite.rwi, prewhiten=TRUE, method="spearman")
mean(MySite.rho [,1])

### Building a mean value chronology (standard chronology). After detrending, build a chronology by averaging across 
# the years of the rwi object. In dplR the function for doing this is chron which by default uses Tukeyâ€™s biweight robust 
# mean (an average that is unaffected by outliers). This object has the same number of rows as the rwi object that was 
# used as the input and two columns. The first gives the chronology and the second the sample depth (the number of 
# series available in that year). ie: dim(ca533.rwi)

## Standard only chrono:
MySite.crn <- chron(MySite.rwi, prefix="XXX")

## Both Standard and Residual chronologies in one file
MySite.crnr <- chron(MySite.rwi, prefix="XXX", prewhiten=TRUE)

## If preferred, remove the Standard chronology for writing .crn file ('crn' must have two columns)
MySiter.crn <- MySite.crnr[,-1]

## Plot the chronologies and sample depth
plot(MySite.crn, add.spline=TRUE, nyrs=20, ylab = 'Index')
plot(MySite.crnr, add.spline=TRUE, nyrs=20, ylab = 'Index')
## Write .crn file.
write.csv(MySite.crnr, file="MySite Chronologies.csv")

### After Building a mean value chronology, determine Expressed Population Signal (EPS) cutoff (typically 
# 0.85, but should be selected by you based on site characteristics and research objectives) then plot.
def.par <- par(no.readonly=TRUE)
# Arbitrary EPS cutoff for demonstration
