## Replication code for 'Abiotic influences on continuous conifer forest structure across a subalpine watershed' (Worsham et al., 2024).

This repository contains code used for data processing, analysis, and inference in 'Abiotic influences on continuous conifer forest structure across a subalpine watershed' (Worsham et al., 2024). In the paper, we quantified the relative influence of climate, topographic, edaphic, and geologic factors on conifer stand structure and composition, and their functional relationships, in Colorado's East River watershed and adjacent drainages. We used waveform LiDAR data to derive spatially continuous stand structure metrics within this upper montaneâ€“subalpine domain. We fused these with a species-level classification map to estimate tree species abundance. We applied generalized additive and generalized boosted models to evaluate the covariability of structural and compositional metrics with abiotic variables.

The repository is complete in the sense that it includes all operations used in the analysis and reported in the paper. However, it does not include initial exploratory efforts or analytical dead-ends---approaches that failed or that we ultimately abandoned in favor of more reliable or efficient methods. Many of the operations, particularly those that process waveform LiDAR, require parallel implementation on large-scale, high-performance computing infrastructure because of data burden (1E+12 bytes) or algorithmic complexity. Operations for directly reproducing publication tables and figures will run on a personal computer.

## Requirements

The bulk of the analysis runs in the R statistical computing environment and is configured for Apple Mac and Linux operating systems. R session specifications are in `./config/r_session_info`. The header of every R script in the repository contains a call to load a YAML configuration file, `./config/config.yml`. This file contains a list of packages and a list of local and external paths for ingesting data, models, and other requisite information and is required for any subsequent code in the script to run. On execution, R scripts will automatically try to install the required packages and their dependencies (if not already present) and load them in the global environment. 

Note: two of the R packages in the configuration file are not available on CRAN and may need to be installed manually if automatic installation fails. They are **lidRplugins** and **rwaveform**. These packages are not necessary for replicating tables and figures, only for waveform processing and individual tree detection. 

To install **lidRplugins**, open an R session and run:
```
remotes::install_github('Jean-Romain/lidRplugins')
```

To install **rwaveform**, open an R session and run:

```
remotes::install_github('hmworsham/rwaveform')
```

## Replicating tables and figures

To replicate all tables and figures, open a `bash` shell. From the repository root, navigate to './inst/notebooks/tables_figures/' and run: 

```sh
chmod u+x code/replicate_all.sh
./replicate_all.sh
```

On execution, replication scripts for tables and figures will automatically try to download source data from the public [ESS-DIVE data repository](https://data.ess-dive.lbl.gov/view/ess-dive-2377c69d12defc3-20240702T013021190) associated with this project (Worsham et al. 2024) using the web file retrieval protocol *wget*. For the most part, source data are not stored locally, so downloading is necessary for the scripts to generate the tables and figures.

## Repository structure

The repository is organized much like a standard R package stored on the Comprehensive R Archive Network, following the 'Research Compendium' framework described in Marwick et al. (2018). In this framework, compendium components are separated into distinct classes, and a clear separation is maintained between data, analytical functions, analytical scripts implementing those functions, and output. The file structure in the root directory of this repository enforces this separation. A summary follows below, with a full directory tree and file-level metadata below that. 

- **config:** stores configuration files for environment setup and external data source management
- **data:** stores raw, intermediate, and final processed data output; note: because of the compute scale of this analysis, most input and output data are not stored in this repository but rather in external cloud storage buckets, from which they are ingested into memory on the fly
- **inst:** stores scripts for processing data, running analyses, and generating manuscript elements, including tables and figures
	- **ms:** stores source files for the publication manuscript; LaTEx source files for styles, references, and author metadata; and subdirectories containing final files for submitted tables and figures
		-**figures:** stores final output files for submitted tables and figures
		-**tables:** stores final output files for submitted tables and figures
	- **notebooks:** stores scripts used for data processing and analysis
		- **composition**: stores an R markdown file containing the full analytical workflow for subsetting individual tree crown (ITC) objects to top-of-canopy, assigning species to ITC objects, and computing performance statistics
		- **LiDAR**: stores multiple scripts for cleaning and processing waveform LiDAR data, discretizing waveforms to point cloud, training and testing individual tree crown detection (ITD) algorithms, implementing an optimal ITD algorithm for the full domain, estimating allometric equations, predicting species, and producing gridded estimates of forest structure
		- **misc**: stores multiple scripts for miscellaneous operations, including computing statistics describing the study domain and submitting data to a permanent ESS-DIVE repository
		- **regressions:** stores scripts for building model frames and estimating inferential models on explanatory and response variables
		- **state_factors:** contains scripts for processing and cleaning data used for explanatory features in inferential modeling
		- **tables_figures:** contains scripts for generating final tables and figures for the publication manuscript and supplementary information
	- **shell_scripts:** contains bash scripts for parallelizing analytical scripts on multiple nodes on a high-performance computing cluster and for data ingress/egress using rclone
- **man:** stores reference manual (man) pages describing the analytical functions in `./R`
- **models:** stores inferential model objects, typically an intermediate or final output of one or more analytical scripts
- **R:** stores R files containing generalized functions sourced in analytical scripts
