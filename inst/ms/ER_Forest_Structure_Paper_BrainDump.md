"Terrestrial ecosystem development, which involves changes in ecosystem structure and function over time scales of centuries to millennia, is widely thought to be controlled by the five state factors that also control pedogenesis: time of development (i.e., age), climate, topography, parent material, and organisms (notably vegetation)"

"studies quantifying the relative contribution of the five state factors1–3 to terrestrial ecosystem development across global biomes have been particularly lacking" (Delgado-Baquerizo et al. 2020)

"Nevertheless, elucidating the relative importance of these state factors in regulating ecosystem structure and function from local to global scales is a fundamental question in ecology and biogeochemistry. Such knowledge would advance our understanding of how ecosystems develop through time, and improve forecasts and management options for ecosystems on a planet subjected to large and interacting changes in climate and land-use."

"Taken together, our findings provide key insights into the natural history of terrestrial ecosystems, and suggest that global climatic and land-use changes could have implications for the longer-term trajectories in ecosystem development."

"In many studies of undulating terrain, height growth of forest trees has been correlated with variables that describe landform. Significant ones have included slope azimuth, slope gradient, position on the slope, length of slope, and geometric shape of the site. The landform variables associated with tree growth, however, have been inconsistent among studies."

"Hack and Goodlett (1960) suggested viewing the landscape as an irregular matrix of curvilinear geometric shapes and hypothesized that the distribution and basal area stocking of forest vegetation is correlated with the effects of land surface shapes on movement of water"

### McNab 1993

"Landform significantly affects site productivity and distribution of forest tree species (Rowe and Sheard 1981; Barnes et al. 1982; Bailey 1988)."

"Landform influences many environmental characteristics, including distribution of precipitation through concentration or dispersal of subsurface water" (Helvey et al. 1972), physical properties of soils (Hack and Goodlett 1960), and the atmospheric environment near the ground (Geiger 1965). 

"soil-site studies in the Appalachian Mountains show that landform strongly influences height growth of oaks (Auchmoody and Smith 1979), pines, and yellow-poplar (Ike and Huppuch 1968)."

### Bolstad 2018

"Topography can also influence disturbance frequency and magnitude, drought and temperature stress, wind exposure, in turn influencing biotic structure and composition"

"Species mix can be in part driven by terrain... affinities for particular landscape positions attributed to trait strategies suggesting adaptation to moisture gradients (Whittaker 1956, Bahari et al. 1986, Day and Monk 1988, Elliott 1999, Denslow et al. 2010, Hawthorne and Minat 2018)"

"While general relationships between terrain and mature forest height, biomass, other structural characteristics are widely acknowledged...these relationships have been quantified in relatively few instances"

"In general, stem diameter, tree basal area, and growth rates decrease from cove to ridge and from polar (north-facing in the Northern Hemisphere) to equatorial (south-facing) exposures, corresponding to changes in microclimate (Tajchman et al. 1988, Bolstad et al. 1998b)"

"Authors have speculated that lower growth is due to drier soils from cove to ridges and higher vapor pressure deficits or drier soils from northeast to southwest exposures (Tajchman et al. 1988, Fekedulegn et al. 2003), and to shorter growing seasons and cooler temperatures at high elevations (Whittaker 1956, Meiners et al. 1984, Day and Monk 1988, Bolstad et al. 1998b, Fekedulegn et al. 2003)"

"While general trends are assumed, height and biomass differences among landscape positions have rarely been quantified, in part due to difficulties in landscape-scale measurements of climate and forest structure across a broad range of conditions."


# Introduction

High elevation watersheds supply as much as 80 percent of the freshwater on which the region’s 75 million people rely (Bales et al. 2006). Forests are key regulators of these watersheds’ hydrological budgets 65–95 percent of the water flowing out of these watersheds leaves via evapotranspiration, the preponderance transpired by plants (Bonan 2002, Rasmussen 2014). Two anticipated climatic trends amplify the urgency. First, mean annual temperature is expected to increase by between 2.7ºC (RCP4.5) and 4.8ºC (RCP8.5) across the West by the end of the century (USGRCP 2017). Second, deficits of precipitation and soil moisture are projected to occur with greater frequency and intensity in the region under a range of emissions scenarios (Cook et al. 2020). 

One key gap concerns the influence of topography on forest characteristics such as species composition and structure, and on forest processes such as growth, trace gas flux, and death. In mountainous terrain, topographic gradients create relief units whose microclimatic characteristics (e.g. soil moisture, water vapor pressure, temperature) diverge from regional means. These relief units may either buffer organisms against unfavorable climatic changes or exacerbate climate stress (Jones 1992, Dobrowski 2011, Adams et al. 2014, Hannah et al. 2014).

During drought, topography also acts through local climate modification to condition tree responses. Topoclimatic variability can buffer organisms against adverse climatic changes or expose them to greater stress (Dobrowski 2011, Adams et al. 2014, Hannah et al. 2014). Trees typically experience higher vulnerability to moisture deficit at lower elevations, in areas of higher potential insolation, at ridgetop, shoulder and backslope positions, and on locally convex slopes (Allen and Breshears 1998, Gitlin et al. 2006, Dyer 2009, Wainwright et al. 2020). In forests with snow-driven precipitation regimes, higher elevations and convergent positions can produce refugia, where slow-melting snow provides a steady moisture supply later into the growing season and subsurface moisture reserves buffer forest stands against desiccation stress. Topographic signals have been found in patterns of drought-related tree mortality in montane and subalpine conifer forests (Paz-Kagan et al. 2017). Growth responses to drought conditions also appear to be mediated by the temperature and moisture gradients associated with topographic relief units (Fritts, 1974, Adams et al. 2014, Zweifel et al. 2006, Zweifel et al. 2009). 

Interannual growth responses to water limiting-conditions also appear to be mediated by the temperature and moisture gradients associated with topographic relief units (Fritts, 1974, Adams et al. 2014, Zweifel et al. 2006, Zweifel et al. 2009).Topography can influence stand structure and composition by regulating growth—temperature limitations at higher elevations tend to reduce tree growth rates, often producing small-statured stands of high number density but low aboveground biomass—and by influencing a site’s exposure to disturbance. Even moderate changes along gradients of elevation, hillslope position, slope, and aspect can give rise to significant differences in stand composition and structure. Structural and compositional variability then interacts with local geophysics to influence the magnitude and partitioning of evapotranspirative fluxes.

Because biogeochemical fluxes between forests and the atmosphere are influenced by canopy and stand structure, measuring these characteristics is a central objective in forest ecology, conservation, and management (Waring and Running 1998). However, efforts to scale structural and compositional metrics such as stand density, age-class distribution, allometry, and species composition from observations in forest plots to the watershed or landscape can yield substantial error. 

Several studies of spatial variability of stand density, size distribution, and species distribution in montane and subalpine forests have produced inconsistent results (Underwood et al. 2010, Lyderson and North 2012). While it is often thought that upper slopes and ridges support stands of lower density and size than convergent sites, this pattern appears to vary across watersheds and landscapes, and it is often mediated by elevation (Kelsey et al. 2018). This suggests that at least some of the inferences made about these relationships reflect an insufficient reckoning of how independent topographic characteristics interact to affect the hydrologic and energetic conditions in which plants grow (Lookingbill and Urban 2004). For a long time, a major limitation in assessing these relationships has been the lack of spatially continuous data for characterizing forest structure—a limitation that can now be overcome with active remote sensing technologies like light detection and ranging (LiDAR).

However, several key problems beset the foregoing studies. First, while plot- and transect-based data can provide reliable estimates of aboveground forest structure and composition when scaled up to a stand, these data are by nature limited in spatial extent and do not represent the full range of topographic, microclimatic, and edaphic variability that constrains the distribution of vegetation across a landscape (Hurtt et al. 2004, Antonarakis et al. 2011, Lyderson and North 2012, Antonarakis et al. 2014). Therefore, prior work may have failed to capture important dimensions of co-variability. Kane et al. (2015) is the only study I have been able to identify that related quasi-independent measures of topography to spatially continuous measures of forest structure in a montane/subalpine domain, although more results have been reported from tropical forests (e.g. Chadwick and Asner 2015, Jucker et al. 2018). A further concern is that the statistical modeling strategies used in prior studies are unable to quantify potential interactions among topographic variables. Because factors such as elevation, hillslope, and curvature work together to define a site’s radiation and moisture environment, failing to account for these interactions may amount to a significant oversight. In part because of these limitations, ecology still lacks a complete accounting of how forest physiognomy co-varies with topography.

Topographic properties such as elevation, slope, hillslope position, curvature, and aspect substantially influence local microclimate and soil moisture variability (Dobrowski 2011). As a result, they directly and indirectly constrain trees’ growing environments, influencing demographic rates and ultimately shaping stand structure, composition, and function (Lyderson and North 2012, Kane et al. 2015). Even in low-diversity forests, physiognomy can vary dramatically with small changes in position. This variability is often especially pronounced in mountainous terrain, owing to the potential for large changes in elevation, slope, and aspect over small horizontal distances (Dobrowski 2011).

Quantifying the drivers of fine-scale heterogeneity in the structure, composition, and function of montane and subalpine forests is important for several reasons. First, understanding the factors that shape landscape vegetation patterns remains a foundational question in ecology and conservation (Waring and Running 1998, Turner and Gardner 2015). Second, as in most systems that face the imminent prospect of novel drought and disturbance regimes, there is a need for reference data against which scientists and managers can observe change (Millar et al. 2007). Third, understanding the drivers of heterogeneity is essential for forecasting how mountain forests will respond to regional environmental change, and for devising conservation and management strategies that promote forest resilience. And fourth, much of this work remains incomplete. 

## Topography
There is a well established tradition in ecology of using gradient analyses to infer the role of environmental factors in governing state properties of ecosystems (Vitousek and Matson 1991). Notable examples include Jenny’s state factor model of soil and ecosystem formation and Stephenson’s work relating global ecosystem physiognomy to potential and actual evapotranspiration (Jenny 1961, Stephenson 1990). In forest ecosystems, gradient analysis has consistently identified temperature and water balance as the strongest abiotic factors explaining vegetation species distributions and emergent properties such as canopy structure and carbon density (Veblen 1986, Urban et al. 2000, Hessberg et al. 2007, Holden and Jolly 2011). Many gradient studies have used elevation and convergence as proxies for temperature and soil moisture (Stephenson 1998), while others have developed more complex metrics that combine factors such as elevation, hillslope position, aspect, and slope into climate-proxy indices (Lyderson and North 2012). A challenge common to all of these approaches is that temperature and water balance are generally not independent of each other, so the explanatory variables end up shedding little light on the sensitivity of physiognomy to underlying physical gradients (Urban et al. 2000).

A smaller body of work has examined forest structure–topography relationships using suites of quasi-independent measures of topography (see, for example, Hadley 1994, Urban et al. 2000, Underwood et al. 2010, Kane et al. 2015). Urban and colleagues (2000) used elevation, slope aspect, topographic convergence, and soil depth to model a “physical template” describing the light, temperature, and soil moisture regime of a Sierra Nevada domain, and then examined the sensitivity of modeled forest stand basal area, fuel loading, and canopy depth to the topographic inputs. Underwood and colleagues (2010) used elevation, slope, aspect, solar radiation, and topographic wetness to divide a Sierra Nevada domain into “landscape management units” representing nine clusters of topographic variability, and examined variation in stem and species density across those units. Their effort relied on data collected in situ from 164 transects. Ng et al. (2020), similarly, used forest plot data to examine variation in canopy spatial patterns across three hillslope positions (valley, ridge, mid-slope). 

Based on these studies’ findings, some general trends are evident. It appears that topographic factors are important determinants of forest structure and composition, and that elevation, aspect, and hillslope position matter most. (However, see Kane et al. 2015, where topography explained little of the variance in forest structure in a domain with a frequent fire return interval). Basal area and stem density per hectare tend to be lowest on upper slopes and ridges and highest in valleys and canyons (Ng et al. 2020, Underwood et al. 2010). Canopy cover is often lowest on ridgetops and highest on mid-slopes. Ridges and mid-slopes tend to support stands of lower diameter and height distribution, while valley stands skew toward larger diameter classes (Ng et al. 2020). However, Lyderson and North (2012) reported contrary findings in a Sierra Nevada mixed conifer forest, where upper slopes had both the highest quadratic mean diameter (QMD) and the tallest trees. 

In subalpine forests of the southern Rocky Mountains, species composition also varies with topography. Hadley (1994) reported that ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) dominated xeric sites in the Colorado Front Range, including low-elevation south-facing slopes and steep, shallow-soiled north-facing slopes. Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) dominated mesic sites, including north-facing toe-slopes and high-elevation south-facing slopes. Lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) also occurs on dry upper slopes in the lower range of the subalpine zone (2700–3000 m a.s.l.) (Veblen 1986). Engelmann spruce (Picea engelmannii) and subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa) tend to co-occur throughout the subalpine zone. At middle and high elevations up to treeline, the longer-lived spruce is often the canopy dominant (~70 percent of canopy basal area), while fir may occupy up to the same proportion of the understory (Alexander et al. 1984). Near treeline, pure spruce stands are common, while fir often dominate the canopy in the lower end of the subalpine zone, particularly in xeric topographic positions (Alexander 1987). 

## Soil
"We focus on topsoil (0–10 cm soil depth) for three reasons. First, this is the most commonly used soil sampling depth in comparable studies. Second, this uppermost layer is typically biologically the most active in terms of plant roots, microbial biomass, labile nutrient pools, and C exchange with the atmosphere."

"parent material, climate, vegetation, and topography together explain 24 times more variation in multiple ecosystem properties than soil age alone"

"spatial state factors explained, on average, seven (parent material alone; 14.5%), four (climate alone; 8.0%), and three (vegetation type alone; 6.1%) times more variation in ecosystem properties than soil age alone (2.1%), for the 32 measured soil, plant and microbial ecosystem properties"

## LiDAR		

Field plot–based inventories can provide reliable estimates of aboveground forest structure and composition (Medvigy et al., 2009). However, plot measurements are limited in spatial extent, and they may not fully represent the range of variability in state factors that constrains the distribution of vegetation across an entire watershed (Hurtt et al. 2004, Antonarakis et al. 2011, Antonarakis et al. 2014). Moreover, even within mature, close-canopied forests, characteristics such as stand density, age-class distribution, allometry, species composition, and species dominance can have wide variance and efforts to scale these properties up to a watershed from plot observations alone can yield substantial error terms. For example, inferences of tree diameter-height relationships derived from plot observations and static allometric equations have been found to overestimate stem height in inverse proportion to sample size (Duncanson et al. 2015). However, the challenges imposed by topographic variability do not constrain plot-based estimates only. Allometric coefficients—and even functional forms—vary with species as well as topography: conifer height tends to decrease with altitude and soil water availability (Swensen and Weiser 2010, Hulshof et al. 2015). Remote sensing–derived characterizations of forest structure that rely on static allometries are therefore also limited in their capacity to scale forest structural properties in a topographically complex watershed.

Merging remote sensing with field observations holds promise for overcoming these challenges. Waveform LiDAR data can be used to delineate individual canopy trees and to estimate individual-scale characteristics, such as stem diameter, stem height, stem volume, and crown volume (Dalponte et al. 2011, Zhao et al. 2009, Jucker et al. 2017). These data have also been used to generate continuous (i.e., non–object based) estimates of forest structure parameters at the pixel-grid scale; these parameters include aboveground biomass, leaf-area index, total number density, and diameter-class distribution. The fidelity of object-oriented and continuous-estimate methods appears to improve when LiDAR observations are integrated with imaging spectrometry and calibrated against in situ stem diameter and height measurements (Antonarakis et al. 2011, Jucker et al. 2017).

Advances in active remote sensing, including light detection and ranging (LiDAR), have opened up new opportunities for characterizing forest structure on a continuous basis for a wide array of scientific and management applications (Mallet and Bretar 2009). In particular, over the past five years a profusion of full waveform LiDAR datasets from aerial and satellite platforms, and emerging open-source libraries for cleaning and processing the data, has enabled more accurate estimates of forest structure than those from discrete-return acquisitions (Zhou and Popescu 2017). Like discrete-return points, waveform data can be used to delineate individual canopy trees and to estimate individual-scale characteristics such as stem diameter, stem height, stem volume, and crown volume (Dalponte et al. 2011, Jucker et al. 2017). Waveforms can also be processed to generate continuous estimates of forest structure parameters at the pixel-grid scale; these parameters include aboveground biomass, leaf-area index, total number density, and diameter-class distribution. Using the full waveforms appears to improve the accuracy of both object-oriented and continuous-estimate methods over discrete-return estimates, particularly for characterizing mid-canopy and sub-canopy structure. Integrating waveforms with imaging spectrometry and calibrating remote sensing against in situ stem diameter and height measurements also yields accuracy improvements (Antonarakis et al. 2011, Jucker et al. 2017). 


## Gaps and objectives
Active remote sensing technologies, including light detection and ranging (LiDAR), have shown promise for accurately estimating forest structure, but analyses using discrete-return acquisitions often fail to capture midcanopy and subcanopy structure. Here, I integrate a waveform LiDAR dataset acquired over Colorado’s East River watershed with a species classification dataset derived from imaging spectrometry and field inventory measurements of 7000+ trees to quantify the spatial variability of forest canopy structure through the vertical profile, as well as stand structure and composition. I then use statistical modeling techniques to evaluate the topographic and edaphic regulation of forest stand structure and composition at a single point and time. 

In this project, I address the following questions: 

1.	To what extent are tree stem height and diameter distributions influenced by the elevation, slope, hillslope position, solar radiation, aspect, and topographic wetness of a site?

2.	To what extent are total number density, basal area, and species composition controlled by the same topographic factors?

3.	How do the specified topographic factors interact to mediate these relationships?

Based on prior findings in the literature, I have identified three central hypotheses to test. First, I expect that the interaction between elevation and topographic wetness is a stronger explainer of total stem density and basal area than any single topographic variable, and that both density and basal area will vary inversely with the two-way interactions. Second, I expect that a clear division exists between pine and spruce-fir distributions, explained by the interactions between elevation, aspect, and hillslope. In general, I expect pine to dominate lower-elevation and south-facing slopes and spruce-fir to dominate north-facing slopes and higher elevation positions. However, I anticipate that the interaction between elevation and hillslope position will complicate this general trend somewhat, because of cool-air pooling that allows lower minimum temperatures and lower evaporative demand to persist in valley bottoms, even at low elevations where pine would otherwise be expected (Dobrowksi 2011). Third, I expect spruce and fir total stem density to diverge, with spruce density increasing with elevation and fir density reaching a peak at mid-elevations. 

To test these hypotheses, I will quantify the spatial variability of forest canopy structure through the vertical profile, as well as stand structure and composition, using full waveform LiDAR, aerial imaging spectrometry, and field observations. I will then use statistical modeling techniques to evaluate the topographic regulation of forest stand structure and composition at one point in time.


# Methods

## Study Domain
The domain for this project comprises subalpine conifer and aspen forest stands in Colorado’s East River watershed (38°55’ N, 106°56’ W; Fig. 1). The East River is a headwater tributary of the Colorado River, the principal freshwater source for one in 10 people in the U.S. (U.S. Department of the Interior Bureau of Reclamation 2012). The ~750 km2 catchment comprises six major drainages with perennial snowmelt-fed streams. It also has significant topographic heterogeneity: 1420 m of elevational relief, multiple peaks extending above treeline, and pronounced gradients in slope, aspect, insolation, and hillslope position. Mean annual temperature measured at a SNOTEL site (736-Schofield) situated at 3261 m in the watershed is 1.8 º C, with maximum and minimum of 8.3 º C and –28.4 º C respectively. Mean annual precipitation is ~1200 mm y–1; approximately 70 percent falls as snow and 30 percent falls as rain. Maximum air temperatures are depressed by wind at high elevations and minimum air temperatures by cold air downwelling at low elevations. Precipitation is also strongly influenced by elevation, with snow accumulation generally increasing upgradient. 

The system is driven by seasonal temperature and precipitation regimes that impose important controls on vegetation phenology. Winter snows arrive as early as September, and storms may persist into early June at the highest elevations. Snowmelt typically begins in April and continues through June, concurrently with leaf-out and growth onset. A seasonal drydown occurs in late June and July, characterized by sparse rainfall and soil desiccation as evaporative demand rises with summer temperatures (Harte et al. 1995). In most years, this seasonal moisture deficit is partially mitigated by a July–August monsoon. The driest phase occurs over August–September and can drive severe soil moisture deficits in years when the monsoon fails, as it did in 2018. In addition to these broad patterns, the domain’s stark relief and topographic complexity coordinate to produce highly variable local climatic conditions.

The domain spans lower montane to alpine ecosystems (2700 m to 3500 m). The dominant tree species are P. engelmannii, A. lasiocarpa, P. contorta, and Populus tremuloides, with occasional P. menziesii at mid-elevations. The domain is large enough to identify generalizable relationships between topography and forest structure. As a low-diversity system, it also presents a manageable parameter space for analysis.

Between 2018 and 2022, we established 25 long-term forest monitoring plots in the watershed. The sites were stratified across six topographic gradients. Approximately 68 sites were preselected through geospatial analysis of topographic variables derived from the USGS 1/3-arc second digital elevation model (DEM) (citation TK). The gradients are described in Table 1. The distribution of plots along those gradients and correlation statistics for topographic variable pairs appear in Appendix A.

Square 40x40 m plots were installed by staking one corner and running a metric tape in a straight line to a point 40 m away to form one edge of the plot. The cardinal orientation and slope angle between points were measured with a digital compass and laser hypsometer, respectively, and the approximate location of the next corner was sighted at an angle of 90º and distance of 40 m from the first. A second tape was run to the approximate corner, and adjusted to achieve the exact distance and angle. This process was repeated for the four edges. The cardinal orientation and slope angle between corners were then remeasured and the distance between corners was adjusted using trigonometric corrections, to approximate a projected flat-surface area of 1600 m. 

We then conducted a field inventory of [6700] trees in 17 plots that lay within the acquisition footprint of a 2018 NEON Airborne Observation Platform (AOP) campaign. All trees of any species with a diameter at breast height (DBH, measured at 1.3 m) >1.0 cm were tagged with an aluminum tag affixed with a nail if the specimen was >10cm DBH and with an expanding collar if the specimen was <10cm DBH. Measurements taken from each tree are summarized in Table 2. Measurements were taken from more than 6000 conifers for training and validating models developed in the remote sensing analysis.

+ Table 2. Measurements taken in field inventory with their units and a summary of methods.

I have begun to characterize spatial variation in forest structure and species composition using airborne waveform LiDAR and high-fidelity imaging spectrometry observations (Chadwick et al. 2020, Goulden et al. 2020a, Goulden et al. 2020b, Falco et al. 2020). Between June 12 and 26, 2018, the National Ecological Observatory Network's Airborne Observation Platform (NEON AOP; Kampe et al. 2009) conducted a survey of approximately 330 km2 of the watershed, including 10 of our forest inventory plots (Chadwick et al. 2020, Fig. 1). The AOP collected high-fidelity VSWIR spectrometry at 1 m resolution using an AVRIS-NG visible and infrared imaging spectrometer. The platform also collected LiDAR using an Optech Gemini discrete LiDAR sensor and waveform digitizer. The LiDAR sensor’s pulse repetition frequency varied between 33 and 100 kHz. The spectrometer and LiDAR platforms were co-aligned with an onboard GPS/IMU system. Validation was conducted using in situ data at 437 sites representing a range of vegetative and built land cover types. 

Discrete-return point density in the post-processed dataset ranged between 1 and 9 returns m-2, which was insufficient for characterizing subcanopy structure. I have therefore elected to use the full waveforms, which have a nominal density between 1 and 4 pulses m-2. The full-waveform pulses contain considerably more information than discrete points and can be exploited to develop more complete characterizations of stand and canopy structure. 

I plan to generate both an individual tree crown (ITC) map of conifer and aspen forest and continuous gridded estimates of forest structure (as in Dalponte and Coombes 2016). The former will comprise a map of individual tree crowns in mixed-conifer forest stands describing species, height, crown area, and stem diameter of each crown, along with estimates of detection error. The latter will comprise a continuous map of forest structure metrics at 1m, 40m, 100m, and 1km grid scales. 

I have so far focused my efforts on the waveforms intersecting our forest plots to develop a training set for tuning parameters for the watershed-scale mapping effort. For returns intersecting each field plot boundary, I used a spectral deconvolution procedure to isolate the target-response signal from its interactions with the outgoing pulse, atmospheric scattering, and sensor-system noise (Zhou et al. 2017). I then applied an adaptive Gaussian decomposition, which fits one or more Gaussian models to the waveform components based on Equation 1: 

$f(x,θ) = \Sigma_(i=1)^n A_i exp(〖(x-μ_i)〗^λ/(2σ_i^2 ))$			(1)

where $A_i$ is the amplitude of waveform component $i$, $μ$ is the bin location of $i$ (measured as a point in time, ns), $σ$ is the standard deviation of $i$, and $λ$ is a rate parameter that minimizes the model residual over a specified number of iterations. I used the implementation of this algorithm in the waveformlidar package in the R statistical environment (Zhou et al. 2018). The algorithm first identifies potential peaks in the waveform, then iteratively fits models to the data centered on each peak, selecting the model that minimizes root mean square error between the raw waveform and the model and excluding models that produce physically meaningless parameters (such as a negative A). Where multiple peaks exist, the algorithm fits a separate model to each and expresses the final fit as the sum of n Gaussian functions.

After processing the waveforms, I geolocated the Gaussian peaks and extracted characteristic metrics from the fitted waveforms. These included the peaks’ location in three-dimensional space, their amplitude and width, front slope, and time to median intensity. I then used the R package lidR to discretize this information, creating an array of information-enriched points overlying the boundaries of each forest plot. I normalized the points to the earth’s surface by kriging the ground returns and subtracting z values from the interpolated surface (Fig. 3).


This effort is generating both an individual tree crown (ITC) map of conifer and aspen forest and continuous gridded estimates of forest structure (as in Dalponte and Coombes 2016). The former will comprise a map of individual tree crowns in mixed-conifer forest stands describing species, height, crown area, and stem diameter of each crown, along with estimates of detection error. The latter will comprise a continuous map of forest structure metrics at 1m, 40m, 100m, and 1km grid scales. 

For returns intersecting each field plot boundary, the waveforms have been processed using a spectral deconvolution and Gaussian decomposition, and a digital terrain model has been generated by interpolating over the last peak locations. After normalizing the waveforms to ground level, we extracted characteristic metrics from waveform peaks. These include the peaks’ location in 3-dimensional space, peak amplitude and width, canopy height, height percentiles, and return density across the vertical profile. We have applied these metrics within the ITC delineation algorithm ITCsegment in the R statistical environment (Dalponte and Coombes 2016).

As a next step, the field data from each of our mixed-conifer plots and equivalent data from a subset of aspen plots inventoried by Ben Blonder’s research group, will be applied to parameterize and validate the ITC model through fitting linear and Gaussian process models. The field data will be split into training (80%) and validation (20%) sets, with the validation set reserved for final error estimation and the training set iteratively resampled using k-fold cross-validation. The ITC procedure will be iteratively re-parameterized by adjusting window size, maximum allowed crown diameter, and vertical and horizontal search coefficients until cross-validation produces suitable crown detection rate scores across size classes.

Next, the ITC objects will be fused with a 1 m resolution forest species classification dataset, developed through a support vector machine classifier on 2018 NEON AOP hyperspectral imagery (Falco 2020). Each object will be assigned to a given tree species according to the majority rule, i.e., if 50% or more of the pixels intersecting the object are classified to that species (Dalponte et al. 2019). For trees where <50% of pixels belong to a single species, the object will be labeled “unknown.”

To estimate the stem diameters of each delineated object, I will use an ensemble regression approach trained on ITC height and crown area and field-measured diameters assigned to objects in plots, using 10-fold cross-validation. The classification will again be cross-validated with geolocation, height, diameter, and species records from field data. This cross-validation and reparameterization process is required because allometric relationships between height, tree diameter, and crown area can vary widely with elevation, exposure, and other factors. 

I will use the optimized parameters to run the ITC procedure on all of the waveforms, and validate on the 20% of data reserved in the initial training-validation split. From the full ITC model, I plan compute continuous area-based structural and compositional metrics, including total number density, species density, basal area, and canopy cover, and max and mean diameter will by summarizing object-level predictions at specified grid scales across the watershed. The metrics will include total tree number density, size class density, basal area, canopy cover, and maximum and mean diameter. They will also include species-explicit estimates including species composition (proportion of pixel area occupied by each species), species density (number of individuals of each species per pixel), and species dominance (majority species per pixel). 

I will use these structure and composition data layers along with topographic features derived from a digital elevation model, all at 100m resolution, to evaluate the effects of topographic position on species composition and forest structure. The proposed explanatory and response variables are summarized in Table 2.

TODO: FIND ANALOGUE: "Yellow-poplar is a mesophytic species that responds in height growth mainly to physical properties that affect the capacity of the soil to supply moisture and somewhat to soil chemical properties (McNab 1989: Beck and Della-Bianca 1981)"
	- height correlated with depth of organic matter?
	- height correlated with leaf litter?
	- wind-caused redeposition of forest litter and nutrient-loaded dust?

How are soil organic matter, soil depth correlated with concavity, convexity?

TODO: FIND ANALOGUE: "differential rates of litter accumulation and decomposition, and its subsequent effects on soil physical properties, may be a contributing cause of the differences in growth of yellow-poplar on microsites with various land surface shapes" (McNab 1989)

"minor landforms may be a more important source of areal site variation within stands... than previously recognized" (McNab 1989)

## Limitations
- We don't account for:
	- Disturbance
	- Individual life histories
	- Anthropogenic development and logging legacy
	- Non-woody vegetation
	- Subsurface ecology--micorrhizal networks, microbiome, which exert control on tree productivity and composition through association
