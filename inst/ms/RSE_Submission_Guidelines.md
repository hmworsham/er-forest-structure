## Figures
As a general rule, the lettering on the artwork should have a finished, printed size of 7 pt for normal text and no smaller than 6 pt for subscript and superscript characters. Smaller lettering will yield text that is hardly legible. This is a rule-of-thumb rather than a strict rule. There are instances where other factors in the artwork (e.g., tints and shadings) dictate a finished size of perhaps 10 pt.

When Elsevier decides on the size of a line art graphic, in addition to the lettering, there are several other factors to assess. These all have a bearing on the reproducibility/readability of the final artwork. Tints and shadings have to be printable at finished size. All relevant detail in the illustration, the graph symbols (squares, triangles, circles, etc.) and a key to the diagram (explaining the symbols used) must be discernible.

## Conflict of interest disclosure
Corresponding authors, on behalf of all the authors of a submission, must disclose any financial and personal relationships with other people or organizations that could inappropriately influence (bias) their work. Examples of potential conflicts of interest include employment, consultancies, stock ownership, honoraria, paid expert testimony, patent applications/registrations, and grants or other funding. All authors, including those without competing interests to declare, should provide the relevant information to the corresponding author (which, where relevant, may specify they have nothing to declare). Corresponding authors should then use this tool to create a shared statement and upload to the submission system at the Attach Files step. Please do not convert the .docx template to another file type. Author signatures are not required.

## Author contributions
For transparency, we require corresponding authors to provide co-author contributions to the manuscript using the relevant CRediT roles. The CRediT taxonomy includes 14 different roles describing each contributor’s specific contribution to the scholarly output. The roles are: Conceptualization; Data curation; Formal analysis; Funding acquisition; Investigation; Methodology; Project administration; Resources; Software; Supervision; Validation; Visualization; Roles/Writing - original draft; and Writing - review & editing. Note that not all roles may apply to every manuscript, and authors may have contributed through multiple roles. More details and an example.

## Funding sources and their roles in research
You are requested to identify who provided financial support for the conduct of the research and/or preparation of the article and to briefly describe the role of the sponsor(s), if any, in study design; in the collection, analysis and interpretation of data; in the writing of the report; and in the decision to submit the article for publication. If the funding source(s) had no such involvement, it is recommended to state this.
