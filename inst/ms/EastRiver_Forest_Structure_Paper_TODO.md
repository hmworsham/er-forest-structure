# DRAFT 4 TODO

## Analysis
- Run LayerStacking on full domain
- Take out the gap-filled area
- Rerun everything with LS-derived tree crown map
- Export all results to eastriver Drive

## Tables, Figures, Numbers, Equations
- EQ: Write allometric equation and coefficients for methods
- FIG: Partial effects plots for ALL significant variables in GAM
- FIG: Partial dependence plots for significant variables in GBM
- NUM: Median and s.d. density at inventory sites
- NUM: Mean basal area at inventory sites
- FIG: Comparison of PC density, original NEON vs discretized waveform
- NUM: Elevation maximum density, height, etc.
- NUM: TWI values 
- CAP: Update Fig. 7 caption
- FIG: Figure with detected trees and CHM underlay
- FIG: Map with missing flightpath and gap-filled showing density discrepancy
- FIG: Re-create structure maps without gap-fill

## Revisions
- Mention variables dropped from models for multicollinearity!! (TWI, etc.)
- Mention the missing flightpath and that we attempted to gap-fill but density results were unreasonable
	- Show map with missing flightpath and gap-fill but showing density discrepancy
- Write abstract
- Fix citations
- A sentence on what deviance explained means in GAM:
	"The deviance generalizes the Residual Sum of Squares (RSS) of the linear model. The generalization is driven by the likelihood and its equivalence with the RSS in the linear model... deviance is defined through the difference of the log-likelihoods between the fitted model, ℓ(^β), and the saturated model, ℓs." (https://bookdown.org/egarpor/PM-UC3M/glm-deviance.html)
- Mention lidR and lidRplugins implenetations of some algorithms

## Draft 3 - complete
X TAB: Make table of abiotic explanatory variables: Name, Category, Units, Source
X TAB: Make table of LayerStacking params for methods
X TAB: Make table of LayerStacking
X FIG: Figure with explanatory variables

## Prior drafts - complete
X Edit protocols for analysis of LiDAR waveform and canopy segmentation
X Read LiDAR papers
X Read papers on forest structure from RMBL drive
X Run TPI at large scale
