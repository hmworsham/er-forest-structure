	abstract = {Image texture is a complex visual perception. With the ever-increasing spatial resolution of remotely sensed data, the role of image texture in image classification has increased. Current approaches to image texture analysis rely on a single band of spatial information to characterize texture. This paper presents a multiscale approach to image texture where first and second-order statistical measures were derived from different sizes of processing windows and were used as additional information in a supervised classification. By using several bands of textural information processed with different window sizes (from 5 × 5 to 15 × 15) the main forest stands in the image were improved up to a maximum of 40\%. A geostatistical analysis indicated that there was no single window size that would adequately characterize the range of textural conditions present in this image. A number of different statistical texture measures were compared for this image..While all of the different texture measures provided a degree of improvement (from 4 to 13\% overall), the multiscale approach achieved a higher degree of classification accuracy regardless of which statistical procedure was used. When compared with single band texture measures, the level of overall improvement varied between 4 and 8\%. The results indicate that this multiscale approach is an improvement over the current single band approach to analysing image texture. © 2004 Taylor and Francis Ltd.},

	abstract = {This letter describes a new algorithm for automatic tree crown delineation based on a model of tree crown density, and its validation. The tree crown density model was first used to create a correlation surface, which was then input to a standard watershed segmentation algorithm for delineation of tree crowns. The use of a model in an early step of the algorithm neatly solves the problem of scale selection. In earlier studies, correlation surfaces have been used for tree crown segmentation, involving modelling tree crowns as solid geometric shapes. The new algorithm applies a density model of tree crowns, which improves the model’s suitability for segmentation of Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS) data because laser returns are located inside tree crowns. The algorithm was validated using data acquired for 36 circular (40 m radius) field plots in southern Sweden. The algorithm detected high proportions of field-measured trees (40–97\% of live trees in the 36 field plots: 85\% on average). The average proportion of detected basal area (cross-sectional area of tree stems, 1.3 m above ground) was 93\% (range: 84–99\%). The algorithm was used with discrete return ALS point data, but the computation principle also allows delineation of tree crowns in ALS waveform data.},

This work concentrates on delineating individual trees in topographically-complex, mixed conifer forest across the California's Sierra Nevada. We delineated individual trees using vector data and a 3D lidar point cloud segmentation algorithm, and using raster data with an object-based image analysis (OBIA) of a canopy height model (CHM). The two approaches are compared to each other and to ground reference data. We used high density (9 pulses/m2), discreet lidar data and WorldView-2 imagery to delineate individual trees, and to classify them by species or species types. We also identified a new method to correct artifacts in a high-resolution CHM. Our main focus was to determine the difference between the two types of approaches and to identify the one that produces more realistic results. We compared the delineations via tree detection, tree heights, and the shape of the generated polygons. The tree height agreement was high between the two approaches and the ground data (r2: 0.93-0.96). Tree detection rates increased for more dominant trees (8-100 percent). The two approaches delineated tree boundaries that differed in shape: the lidar-approach produced fewer, more complex, and larger polygons that more closely resembled real forest structure. © 2013 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {Synthetic aperture radar tomography (TomoSAR) has been proven to be a useful way to reconstruct vertical structure over forest areas with P-band images, on account of its three-dimensional imaging ability. In the case of a small number of non-uniformly distributed acquisitions, compressive sensing (CS) is generally adopted in TomoSAR. However, the performance of CS depends on the selected hyperparameter, which is closely related to the noise of a pixel. In this paper, to overcome this limitation, we propose a sparse iterative covariance-based estimation (SPICE) approach based on the wavelet and orthogonal sparse basis (W \& O-SPICE) for application over forest areas. SPICE is a sparse spectral estimation method that achieves a high vertical resolution, and takes account of the noise adaptively for each resolution cell. Thus, it does not require the user to select a hyperparameter. Furthermore, the used sparse basis not only ensures the sparsity of the forest canopy scattering contribution, but it can also keep the original sparse information of the ground contribution. The proposed method was tested in simulated experiments and the results demonstrated that W \& O-SPICE can successfully reconstruct the vertical structure of a forest. Moreover, three P-band fully polarimetric airborne SAR images with non-uniformly distributed baselines were applied to reconstruct the vertical structure of a tropical forest in Mabounie, Gabon. The underlying topography and forest height were estimated, and the root-mean-square errors (RMSEs) were 6.40 m and 4.50 m with respect to the LiDAR digital terrain model (DTM) and canopy height model (CHM), respectively. In addition, W \& O-SPICE showed a better performance than W \& O-CS, beamforming, Capon, and the iterative adaptive approach (IAA).},

We tested the method using data from forests of northern, interior British Columbia dominated by western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla (Raf.) Sarg.) and western redcedar (Thuja plicata Donn ex D. Don). For both species, the most parsimonious regression models included terms for the effects of tree size, crowding, and shading and separate competitive effects of four different groups of competing species. The models explained 33\%-59\% of the variation in radial growth of the two species. For both species, growth declined more steeply as a function of crowding than shading. There was striking asymmetry in the strength of interspecific competition between hemlock and redcedar, with crowding by hemlock having a strong per capita effect on redcedar, while crowding by redcedar had relatively little effect on the radial growth of hemlock.},

	abstract = {The objective of the U.S. Geological Survey/National Park Service (USGS/NPS) Vegetation Mapping Program is to develop a uniform hierarchical vegetation classification standard and methodology on a Service-wide basis and, using that classification standard and methodology, generate vegetation maps for most of the park units under NPS management. This program is in response to the National Park Service's Natural Resources Inventory and Monitoring Guideline (NPS-75) issued in 1992. The vegetation data are to be automated in a GIS-compatible format, which will provide great flexibility in map design and production, data analysis, data management, and maintenance activities. The use of a standard national vegetation classification scheme and mapping protocols will facilitate effective resource stewardship by ensuring compatibility and widespread use of the information throughout the NPS as well as by other federal and state agencies. These vegetation maps and associated information will support a wide variety of resource assessment, park management, and planning concerns. They will provide a structure for framing and answering critical scientific questions about vegetation types and their relationship to environmental processes across the landscape. They will provide a consistent means for the inventory and monitoring of plant communities and they will support "ecosystem management" by providing a consistent basis for the characterization of the biological components of different ecosystem units. The first step toward the implementation of the mapping program includes the development and documentation of standards and protocols. This is being initiated in three studies: (1) a proposed National Vegetation Classification Standard, (2) Field Methodologies, and (3) Accuracy Assessment Procedures. This document is the result of the second study. The fundamental purpose of this study is to review the scientific basis for vegetation sampling and to propose a standardized field methodology that will serve the objectives of this project. The planning process and field methods that will be used to sample and accurately map the National Vegetation Classification units across all parks are described. The National Vegetation Classification System is the result of synthesizing a great body of earlier scientific effort as well as twenty years of field data collection and scientific analyses by The Nature Conservancy (TNC) and Natural Heritage Program scientists. Confidence levels are assigned to each community type to identify the quantity and the quality of information available. The classification is rigorously reviewed and updated as new data become available.

	abstract = {Forest structure is strongly related to forest ecology, and it is a key parameter to understand ecosystem processes and services. Airborne laser scanning (ALS) is becoming an important tool in environmental mapping. It is increasingly common to collect ALS data at high enough point density to recognize individual tree crowns (ITCs) allowing analyses to move beyond classical stand-level approaches. In this study, an effective and simple method to map ITCs, and their stem diameter and aboveground biomass (AGB) is presented. ALS data were used to delineate ITCs and to extract ITCs’ height and crown diameter; then, using newly developed allometries, the ITCs’ diameter at breast height (DBH) and AGB were predicted. Gini coefficient of DBHs was also predicted and mapped aggregating ITCs predictions. Two datasets from spruce dominated temperate forests were considered: one was used to develop the allometric models, while the second was used to validate the methodology. The proposed approach provides accurate predictions of individual DBH and AGB (R2 =.85 and.78, respectively) and of tree size distributions. The proposed method had a higher generalization ability compared to a standard area-based method, in particular for the prediction of the Gini coefficient of DBHs. The delineation method used detected more than 50\% of the trees with DBH {\textgreater}10 cm. The detection rate was particularly low for trees with DBH below 10 cm, but they represent a small amount of the total biomass. The Gini coefficient of the DBH distribution was predicted at plot level with R2 =.46. The approach described in this work, easy applicable in different forested areas, is an important development of the traditional area-based remote sensing tools and can be applied for more detailed analysis of forest ecology and dynamics.},

The gradient nearest neighbor method integrates vegetation measurements from regional grids of field plots, mapped environmental data, and Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) imagery. In the Oregon coastal province, species gradients were most strongly associated with regional climate and geographic location, whereas variation in forest structure was best explained by Landsat TM variables. At the regional level, mapped predictions represented the range of variability in the sample data, and predicted area by vegetation type closely matched sample-based estimates. At the site level, mapped predictions maintained the covariance structure among multiple response variables. Prediction accuracy for tree species occurrence and several measures of vegetation structure and composition was good to moderate. Vegetation maps produced with the gradient nearest neighbor method are appropriately used for regional-level planning, policy analysis, and research, not to guide local management decisions.},

	abstract = {Researchers in lidar (Light Detection And Ranging) strive to search for the most appropriate laser-based metrics as predictors in regression models for estimating forest structural variables. Many previously developed models are scale-dependent that need to be fitted and then applied both at the same scale or pixel size. The objective of this paper is to develop methods for scale-invariant estimation of forest biomass using lidar data. We proposed two scale-invariant models for biomass: a linear functional model and an equivalent nonlinear model that use lidar-derived canopy height distributions (CHD) and canopy height quantile functions (CHQ) as predictors, respectively. The two models are called functional regression models because the predictors CHD and CHQ are themselves functions or functional data. The model formulation was justified mathematically under moderate assumptions. We also created a fine-resolution biomass map by mapping individual tree component biomass in a temperate forest of eastern Texas with a lidar tree-delineation approach. The map was used as reference data to synthesize training and test datasets at multiple scales for validating the two scale-invariant models. Results suggest that the models can accurately predict biomass and yield consistent predictive performances across a variety of scales with an R2 ranging from 0.80 to 0.95 (RMSE: from 14. 3 Mg/ha to 33.7 Mg/ha) among all the fitted models. Results also show that a training data size of around 50 plots or less was enough to guarantee a good fitting of the linear functional model. Our findings demonstrate the effectiveness of CHD and CHQ as lidar metrics for estimating biomass as well as the capability of lidar for mapping biomass at a range of scales. The functional regression models of this study are useful for lidar-based forest inventory tasks where the analysis units vary in size and shape. They also hold promise for estimating other forest characteristics such as below-ground biomass, timber volume, crown fuel weight, and Leaf Area Index. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.},

The advent of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) remote sensing technology provides an economic and effective method for data acquisition. Therefore, the research of ITCD based on UAV high-resolution images is of significance to improve the efficiency and accuracy of forest resource inventory and remote sensing validation. However, in very high-resolution (defined here with the pixel size smaller than 10 cm) images, the inhomogeneities in the canopy texture can be detrimental to the correct detection of individual trees by computer processing. We applied the bias field estimation, which is used in medical image segmentation, to reduce the within-canopy spectral heterogeneity in the very high-resolution UAV-derived orthophoto. By selecting young Osmanthus and Podocarpus trees that grow in a nursery as the study objects, we tested our method in an orthophoto (with a ground resolution of 2.5 cm) generated from overlapping UAV images. A local intensity clustering was first applied to produce a smoothed bias field image; then, by using morphological operation of opening and closing, the fine texture of the canopy was further smoothed. Finally, individual tree crowns were extracted by applying the marker-controlled watershed segmentation algorithm. The segmentation results were validated by comparing to the manually drawn individual tree crown polygons. The F -scores of the detection rate for Osmanthus and Podocarpus were 98.2\% and 93.1\%, respectively. The result is considerably better than those achieved with similar processing steps but without the bias field treatment. Our study proves that it is feasible and effective to detect and delineate individual tree crowns based on the bias field and marker-controlled watershed segmentation in very-high-resolution images obtained from UAV.},

Using a 12-ha spatially explicit plot censused 13 years apart in an approximately 500-year-old Pseudotsuga–Tsuga forest, we demonstrate significant density-dependent mortality and spatially aggregated tree recruitment. However, the combined effect of these strongly nonrandom demographic processes was to maintain tree patterns in a state of dynamic equilibrium. Density-dependent mortality was most pronounced for the dominant late- successional species, Tsuga heterophylla. The long-lived, early-seral Pseudotsuga menziesii experienced an annual stem mortality rate of 0.84\% and no new recruitment. Late-seral species Tsuga and Abies amabilis had nearly balanced demographic rates of ingrowth and mortality. The 2.34\% mortality rate for Taxus brevifolia was higher than expected, notably less than ingrowth, and strongly affected by proximity to Tsuga. Large-diameter Tsuga structured both the regenerating conspecific and heterospecific cohorts with recruitment of Tsuga and Abies unlikely in neighborhoods crowded with large-diameter competitors (P , 0.001). Density- dependent competitive interactions strongly shape forest communities even five centuries after stand initiation, underscoring the dynamic nature of even equilibrial old-growth forests. Key},

	abstract = {Lidar technology has reached a point where ground and forest canopy elevation models can be produced at high spatial resolution. Individual tree crown isolation and classification methods are developing rapidly for multispectral imagery. Analysis of multispectral imagery, however, does not readily provide tree height information and lidar data alone cannot provide species and health attributes. The combination of lidar and multispectral data at the individual tree level may provide a very useful forest inventory tool. A valley following approach to individual tree isolation was applied to both high resolution digital frame camera imagery and a canopy height model (CHM) created from high-density lidar data over a test site of even aged (55 years old) Douglas-fir plots of varying densities (300, 500, and 725 stems/ha) on the west coast of Canada. Tree height was determined from the laser data within the automated crown delineations. Automated tree isolations of the multispectral imagery achieved 80\%‐90\% good correspondence with the ground reference tree delineations based on ground data. However, for the more open plot there were serious commission errors (false trees isolated) mostly related to sunlit ground vegetation. These were successfully reduced by applying a height filter to the isolations based on the lidar data. Isolations from the lidar data produced good isolations with few commission errors but poorer crown outline delineations especially for the densest plot. There is a complimentarity in the two data sources that will help in tree isolation. Heights of the automated isolations were consistently underestimated versus ground reference trees with an average error of 1.3 m. Further work is needed to test and develop tools and capabilities, but there is an effective synergy of the two high resolution data sources for providing needed forest inventory information. © 2003, Taylor \& Francis Group, LLC.

	abstract = {Passive optical remotely sensed images such as those from the Landsat satellites enable the development of spatially comprehensive, well-calibrated reflectance measures that support large-area mapping. In recent years, as an alternative to field plot data, the use of Light Detection and Ranging (lidar) acquisitions for calibration and validation purposes in combination with such satellite reflectance data to model a range of forest structural response variables has become well established. In this research, we use a predictive modeling approach to map forest structural attributes over the {\textasciitilde} 552 million ha boreal forest of Canada. For model calibration and independent validation we utilize airborne lidar-derived measurements of forest vertical structure (known as lidar plots) obtained in 2010 via a {\textgreater} 25,000 km transect-based national survey. Models were developed linking the lidar plot structural variables to wall-to-wall 30-m spatial resolution surface reflectance composites derived from Landsat Thematic Mapper and Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus imagery. Spectral indices extracted from the composites, disturbance information (years since disturbance and type), as well as geographic position and topographic variables (i.e., elevation, slope, radiation, etc.) were considered as predictor variables. A nearest neighbor imputation approach based on the Random Forest framework was used to predict a total of 10 forest structural attributes. The model was developed and validated on {\textgreater} 80,000 lidar plots, with R2 values ranging from 0.49 to 0.61 for key response variables such as canopy cover, stand height, basal area, stem volume, and aboveground biomass. Additionally, a predictor variable importance analysis confirmed that spectral indices, elevation, and geographic coordinates were key sources of information, ultimately offering an improved understanding of the driving variables for large-area forest structure modeling. This study demonstrates the integration of airborne lidar and Landsat-derived reflectance products to generate detailed and spatially extensive maps of forest structure. The methods are portable to map other attributes of interest (based upon calibration data) through access to Landsat or other appropriate optical remotely-sensed data sources, thereby offering unique opportunities for science, monitoring, and reporting programs.},

	abstract = {The rapid development of light detection and ranging (LiDAR) techniques is advancing ecological and forest research. During the last decade, numerous single tree segmentation techniques have been developed using airborne LiDAR data. However, accurate crown segmentation using terrestrial or mobile LiDAR data, which is an essential prerequisite for extracting branch level forest characteristics, is still challenging mainly because of the difficulties posed by tree crown intersection and irregular crown shape. In the current work, we developed a comparative shortest-path algorithm (CSP) for segmenting tree crowns scanned using terrestrial (T)-LiDAR and mobile LiDAR. The algorithm consists of two steps, namely trunk detection and subsequent crown segmentation, with the latter inspired by the well-proved metabolic ecology theory and the ecological fact that vascular plants tend to minimize the transferring distance to the root. We tested the algorithm on mobile-LiDAR-scanned roadside trees and T-LiDAR-scanned broadleaved and coniferous forests in China. Point-level quantitative assessments of the segmentation results showed that for mobile-LiDAR-scanned roadside trees, all the points were classified to their corresponding trees correctly, and for T-LiDAR-scanned broadleaved and coniferous forests, kappa coefficients ranging from 0.83 to 0.93 were obtained. We believe that our algorithm will make a contribution to solving the problem of crown segmentation in T-LiDAR scanned-forests, and might be of interest to researchers in LiDAR data processing and to forest ecologists. In addition, our research highlights the advantages of using ecological theories as guidelines for processing LiDAR data.},

	abstract = {This work proposes a segmentation method that isolates individual tree crowns using airborne LiDAR data. The proposed approach captures the topological structure of the forest in hierarchical data structures, quantifies topological relationships of tree crown components in a weighted graph, and finally partitions the graph to separate individual tree crowns. This novel bottom-up segmentation strategy is based on several quantifiable cohesion criteria that act as a measure of belief on weather two crown components belong to the same tree. An added flexibility is provided by a set of weights that balance the contribution of each criterion, thus effectively allowing the algorithm to adjust to different forest structures.The LiDAR data used for testing was acquired in Louisiana, inside the Clear Creek Wildlife management area with a RIEGL LMS-Q680i airborne laser scanner. Three 1ha forest areas of different conditions and increasing complexity were segmented and assessed in terms of an accuracy index (AI) accounting for both omission and commission. The three areas were segmented under optimum parameterization with an AI of 98.98\%, 92.25\% and 74.75\% respectively, revealing the excellent potential of the algorithm. When segmentation parameters are optimized locally using plot references the AI drops to 98.23\%, 89.24\%, and 68.04\% on average with plot sizes of 1000m2 and 97.68\%, 87.78\% and 61.1\% on average with plot sizes of 500m2.More than introducing a segmentation algorithm, this paper proposes a powerful framework featuring flexibility to support a series of segmentation methods including some of those recurring in the tree segmentation literature. The segmentation method may extend its applications to any data of topological nature or data that has a topological equivalent.},

	abstract = {The two main approaches to deriving forest variables from laser-scanning data are the statistical area-based approach (ABA) and individual tree detection (ITD). With ITD it is feasible to acquire single tree information, as in field measurements. Here, ITD was used for measuring training data for the ABA. In addition to automatic ITD (ITD auto), we tested a combination of ITD auto and visual interpretation (ITD visual). ITD visual had two stages: in the first, ITD auto was carried out and in the second, the results of the ITD auto were visually corrected by interpreting three-dimensional laser point clouds. The field data comprised 509 circular plots (r=10m) that were divided equally for testing and training. ITD-derived forest variables were used for training the ABA and the accuracies of the k-most similar neighbor (k-MSN) imputations were evaluated and compared with the ABA trained with traditional measurements. The root-mean-squared error (RMSE) in the mean volume was 24.8\%, 25.9\%, and 27.2\% with the ABA trained with field measurements, ITD auto, and ITD visual, respectively. When ITD methods were applied in acquiring training data, the mean volume, basal area, and basal area-weighted mean diameter were underestimated in the ABA by 2.7-9.2\%. This project constituted a pilot study for using ITD measurements as training data for the ABA. Further studies are needed to reduce the bias and to determine the accuracy obtained in imputation of species-specific variables. The method could be applied in areas with sparse road networks or when the costs of fieldwork must be minimized. © 2011 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc. (ISPRS).},

	abstract = {Most countries with significant forest resources have designed and implemented monitoring systems to inventory, at regular intervals, a range of forest stand attributes such as species composition, age, volume, biomass, and disturbance. These inventory systems are typically based upon the interpretation of air photos supplemented by ground measurements, with digital remotely sensed data often used to capture changes within inventory cycles. Light detection and ranging (lidar) and high spatial resolution digital satellite imagery (e.g., QuickBird) offer additional capacity and complementary data sources for inventory assessment, as demonstrated by this study over a 400 ha area on Vancouver Island, British Columbia, Canada. A range of lidar survey parameters were applied to update an existing forest inventory. Results indicate a strong relationship between the small-footprint lidar-derived heights and stand height as derived from aerial photographic interpretation (API) (R = 0.79, p {\textless} 0.05). In addition, there was no statistical difference (p {\textless} 0.05) between stand height as predicted from a complete lidar coverage or when sampled as a single 400 m wide transect (R = 0.89, p {\textless} 0.001). These results demonstrate the utility of lidar data, as a full coverage or sample, in combination with high spatial resolution imagery, as useful data sources for capturing forest inventory stand height and cover information. © 2008, Taylor \& Francis Group, LLC.

Ground-based measurements can be complemented by new light-weight sensors on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) or laser scans from canopy cranes or towers. However, it is still largely unknown how much of the forest canopy volume can be sampled and how occlusion is spatially distributed. We present an approach for highly detailed 3D structure measurements based on TLS on the ground and above canopy measurements from a canopy crane or UAV platform, and assess their spatial sampling in terms of occlusion. Comparing the application in a dense tropical and temperate forest, we demonstrate the ability to sample the complete canopy volume with {\textless}2\% occlusion at very high spatial resolution when combining ground and above canopy measurements. This is necessary for a full canopy reconstruction. Ground-based TLS can provide sufficient coverage when no sampling of leaves and branches at top of canopy is required, whereas UAV or tower-based measurements show considerable occlusion in the mid- and understory. We therefore recommend to perform above canopy measurements under leaf off conditions, in sparse forests, or as an addition to ground measurements if a full representation of the whole canopy is required at very high spatial resolution. The latter can pave the way for studies on light availability, micrometeorology, sensor simulations and algorithm testing and development.},

	abstract = {Tropical forests are a key component of the global carbon cycle, and mapping their carbon density is essential for understanding human influences on climate and for ecosystem-service-based payments for forest protection. Discrete-return airborne laser scanning (ALS) is increasingly recognised as a high-quality technology for mapping tropical forest carbon, because it generates 3D point clouds of forest structure from which aboveground carbon density (ACD) can be estimated. Area-based models are state of the art when it comes to estimating ACD from ALS data, but discard tree-level information contained within the ALS point cloud. This paper compares area-based and tree-centric models for estimating ACD in lowland old-growth forests in Sabah, Malaysia. These forests are challenging to map because of their immense height. We compare the performance of (a) an area-based model developed by Asner and Mascaro (2014), and used primarily in the neotropics hitherto, with (b) a tree-centric approach that uses a new algorithm (itcSegment) to locate trees within the ALS canopy height model, measures their heights and crown widths, and calculates biomass from these dimensions. We find that Asner and Mascaro's model needed regional calibration, reflecting the distinctive structure of Southeast Asian forests. We also discover that forest basal area is closely related to canopy gap fraction measured by ALS, and use this finding to refine Asner and Mascaro's model. Finally, we show that our tree-centric approach is less accurate at estimating ACD than the best-performing area-based model (RMSE 18\% vs 13\%). Tree-centric modelling is appealing because it is based on summing the biomass of individual trees, but until algorithms can detect understory trees reliably and estimate biomass from crown dimensions precisely, areas-based modelling will remain the method of choice.},

These assessments are often limited by data, however, a gap with tremendous potential to be filled through Earth observations (EO), which produce a variety of data across spatial and temporal extents and resolutions. Despite widespread recognition of this potential, in practice few ecosystem service studies use EO. Here, we identify challenges and opportunities to using EO in ecosystem service modeling and assessment. Some challenges are technical, related to data awareness, processing, and access. These challenges require systematic investment in model platforms and data management. Other challenges are more conceptual but still systemic; they are byproducts of the structure of existing ecosystem service models and addressing them requires scientific investment in solutions and tools applicable to a wide range of models and approaches. We also highlight new ways in which EO can be leveraged for ecosystem service assessments, identifying promising new areas of research. More widespread use of EO for ecosystem service assessment will only be achieved if all of these types of challenges are addressed. This will require non-traditional funding and partnering opportunities from private and public agencies to promote data exploration, sharing, and archiving. Investing in this integration will be reflected in better and more accurate ecosystem service assessments worldwide.},

	abstract = {Characterization of tropical forest trees has been limited to field-based techniques focused on measurement of diameter of the cylindrical part of the bole, with large uncertainty in measuring large treeswith irregular shapes, and other size attributes such as total tree height and the crown size. Here, we introduce a methodology to decompose lidar point cloud data into 3D clusters corresponding to individual tree crowns (ITC) that enables the estimation of many biophysical variables of tropical forests such as tree height, crown area, crown volume, and tree number density. The ITC-based approach was tested using airborne high-resolution lidar data collected over the 50-ha Center for Tropical Forest Science (CTFS) plot in the Barro Colorado Island, Panama. The lack of tree height and crown size measurements in the field prohibits the direct validation of the ITC metrics. We assess the reliability of our method by comparing the aboveground biomass (AGB) estimated using ground and lidar individual tree measurements at multiple spatial scales, namely 1ha, 2.25 ha, 4ha, and 6.25 ha. We examined four different lidar-derived AGB models, with three based on individual tree height, crown volume, and crown area, and one with mean top canopy height (TCH) calculated at the plot level using the lidar canopy height model. Results show that the predictive power of all models based on ITC size and TCH increases with decreasing spatial resolution from16.9\% at 1ha for theworst model to 5.0\% at 6.25ha for the best model. The TCH-based model performed slightly better than ITC-based models except at higher spatial scales ({\textasciitilde}4 ha) and when errors due to edge effects associated with tree crowns were reduced. Unlike the TCH models that change regionally depending on forest type and structure allometry, the ITC-based models are derived as a function of individual tree allometry and can be extended globally to all tropical forests. The method for lidar detection of individual crown size overcome some limitations of ground-based inventories such as 1) it is able to access crowns of large trees and 2) it enables the assessment of directional changes in tree density, canopy architecture and forest dynamics over large and inaccessible areas to support robust tropical ecological studies.},

	abstract = {Tropical rainforests comprise complex 3D structures and encompass heterogeneous site conditions; their transpiration contributes to climate regulation. The objectives of our study were to test the relationship between tree water use and crown metrics and to predict spatial variability of canopy transpiration across sites. In a lowland rainforest of Sumatra, we measured tree water use with sap flux techniques and simultaneously assessed crown metrics with drone-based photogrammetry. We observed a close linear relationship between individual tree water use and crown surface area (R2 = 0.76, n = 42 trees). Uncertainties in predicting stand-level canopy transpiration were much lower using tree crown metrics than the more conventionally used stem diameter. 3D canopy segmentation analyses in combination with the tree crown-water use relationship predict substantial spatial heterogeneity in canopy transpiration. Among our eight study plots, there was a more than two-fold difference, with lower transpiration at riparian than at upland sites. In conclusion, we regard drone-based canopy segmentation and crown metrics to be very useful tools for the scaling of transpiration from tree-to stand-level. Our results indicate substantial spatial variation in crown packing and thus canopy transpiration of tropical rainforests.},

	abstract = {Forests are a major component of the global carbon cycle, and accurate estimation of forest carbon stocks and fluxes is important in the context of anthropogenic global change. Airborne laser scanning (ALS) data sets are increasingly recognized as outstanding data sources for high-fidelity mapping of carbon stocks at regional scales. We develop a tree-centric approach to carbon mapping, based on identifying individual tree crowns (ITCs) and species from airborne remote sensing data, from which individual tree carbon stocks are calculated. We identify ITCs from the laser scanning point cloud using a region-growing algorithm and identifying species from airborne hyperspectral data by machine learning. For each detected tree, we predict stem diameter from its height and crown-width estimate. From that point on, we use well-established approaches developed for field-based inventories: above-ground biomasses of trees are estimated using published allometries and summed within plots to estimate carbon density. We show this approach is highly reliable: tests in the Italian Alps demonstrated a close relationship between field- and ALS-based estimates of carbon stocks (r2 = 0·98). Small trees are invisible from the air, and a correction factor is required to accommodate this effect. An advantage of the tree-centric approach over existing area-based methods is that it can produce maps at any scale and is fundamentally based on field-based inventory methods, making it intuitive and transparent. Airborne laser scanning, hyperspectral sensing and computational power are all advancing rapidly, making it increasingly feasible to use ITC approaches for effective mapping of forest carbon density also inside wider carbon mapping programs like REDD++.},

These forest areas are in the focus of REDD+ (reducing emissions from deforestation, forest degradation, and the role of conservation, sustainable management of forests and enhancement of forest carbon stocks) projects, which require an accurate monitoring of their carbon stocks or aboveground biomass (AGB). Our study objective was to evaluate multi-temporal LiDAR measurements of a tropical forested peatland area in Central Kalimantan on Borneo. Canopy height and AGB dynamics were quantified with a special focus on unaffected, selective logged and burned forests. More than 11,000 ha were surveyed with airborne LiDAR in 2007 and 2011. In a first step, the comparability of these datasets was examined and canopy height models were created. Novel AGB regression models were developed on the basis of field inventory measurements and LiDAR derived height histograms for 2007 (r2 = 0.77, n = 79) and 2011 (r2 = 0.81, n = 53), taking the different point densities into account. Changes in peat swamp forests were identified by analyzing multispectral imagery. Unaffected forests accumulated on average 20 t/ha AGB with a canopy height increase of 2.3 m over the four year time period. Selective logged forests experienced an average AGB loss of 55 t/ha within 30 m and 42 t/ha within 50 m of detected logging trails, although the mean canopy height increased by 0.5 m and 1.0 m, respectively. Burned forests lost 92\% of the initial biomass. These results demonstrate the great potential of repetitive airborne LiDAR surveys to precisely quantify even small scale AGB and canopy height dynamics in remote tropical forests, thereby featuring the needs of REDD+. © 2013 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Regression modeling of biomass estimates from an airborne, multiple return lidar system using regional biomass allometric equations differs significantly from those using national scale Jenkins allometric equations with respect to the amount of variation explained, variables selected and variables of importance. Our discrete return lidar data were collected in September 2007 at 121 plots in a conifer dominated forest site in the Sierra Nevada mountains that include a full range of forest density. We regressed field plot-level estimates of biomass derived from field data and two different allometric equations with a range of lidar metrics. We compared regression performance across eight models: (1) point clouds alone, (2) point clouds with an empirical relationship between DBH and height (i.e., volume), (3) individual tree-level metrics, and (4) all data combined, and across two allometric equations - (A) Forest Inventory Analysis (FIA), and (B) Jenkins. In lower biomass plots, the reference above ground biomass (AGB) estimates from regional allometric equations and Jenkins equations were closely related; in plots with large biomass they were different. This finding suggests that published equations from large biomass plots are either not readily available or less represented in national scale allometric equation compiling. Models using reference AGBs calculated from regional allometric equations performed much better than those using reference AGBs calculated from Jenkins allometric equations. In these cases adjusted R 2 improvement ranged from 0.07 to 0.11. The regression model that used regional allometric equations with lidar metrics and individual tree data provided the best overall R 2 (0.79) with lowest RMSE suggesting that in most conditions regional biomass equations should be preferred over national equations. The inclusion of volumetric metrics shows that lidar variables are more sensitive to the reference AGBs calculated from regional allometric equations, and care should be taken when substituting regional equations using national scale compiled allometric equations in regional biomass studies. In addition, consistent with previous studies, the mean height of individual trees identified was chosen by both models with both reference AGBs calculated from regional allometric equations and those calculated from Jenkins equations, supporting the need to identify individual trees for biomass prediction. Based on these results, we conclude that the selection of allometric equations can influence the capacity of lidar data to estimate biomass significantly, and a careful selection of allometric equations is required for regional lidar biomass studies. © 2012 Elsevier B.V..},

	abstract = {Background: Forest canopy height is a key forest structure parameter. Precisely estimating forest canopy height is vital to improve forest management and ecological modelling. Compared with discrete-return LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging), small-footprint full-waveform airborne LiDAR (FWL) techniques have the capability to acquire precise forest structural information. This research mainly focused on the influence of voxel size on forest canopy height estimates. Methods: A range of voxel sizes (from 10.0 m to 40.0 m interval of 2 m) were tested to obtain estimation accuracies of forest canopy height with different voxel sizes. In this study, all the waveforms within a voxel size were aggregated into a voxel-based LiDAR waveform, and a range of waveform metrics were calculated using the voxel-based LiDAR waveforms. Then, we established estimation model of forest canopy height using the voxel-based waveform metrics through Random Forest (RF) regression method. Results and conclusions: The results showed the voxel-based method could reliably estimate forest canopy height using FWL data. In addition, the voxel sizes had an important influence on the estimation accuracies (R2 ranged from 0.625 to 0.832) of forest canopy height. However, the R2 values did not monotonically increase or decrease with the increase of voxel size in this study. The best estimation accuracy produced when the voxel size was 18 m (R2 = 0.832, RMSE = 2.57 m, RMSE\% = 20.6\%). Compared with the lowest estimation accuracy, the R2 value had a significant improvement (33.1\%) when using the optimal voxel size. Finally, through the optimal voxel size, we produced the forest canopy height distribution map for this study area using RF regression model. Our findings demonstrate that the optimal voxel size need to be determined for improving estimation accuracy of forest parameter using small-footprint FWL data.},

	abstract = {The quantification of forest ecosystems is important for a variety of purposes, including the assessment of wildlife habitat, nutrient cycles, timber yield and fire propagation. This research assesses the estimation of forest structure, composition and deadwood variables from small-footprint airborne lidar data, both discrete return (DR) and full waveform (FW), acquired under leaf-on and leaf-off conditions. The field site, in the New Forest, UK, includes managed plantation and ancient, semi-natural, coniferous and deciduous woodland. Point clouds were rendered from the FW data through Gaussian decomposition. An area-based regression approach (using Akaike Information Criterion analysis) was employed, separately for the DR and FW data, to model 23 field-measured forest variables. A combination of plot-level height, intensity/amplitude and echo-width variables (the latter for FW lidar only) generated from both leaf-on and leaf-off point cloud data were utilised, together with individual tree crown (ITC) metrics from rasterised leaf-on height data. Statistically significant predictive models (p{\textless}0.05) were generated for all 23 forest metrics using both the DR and FW lidar datasets, with R2 values for the best fit models in the range R2=0.43-0.94 for the DR data and R2=0.28-0.97 for the FW data (with normalised RMSE values being 18\%-66\% and 16\%-48\% respectively). For all but two forest metrics the difference between the NRMSE of the best performing DR and FW models was ≤7\%, and there was an even split (11:12) as to which lidar dataset (DR or FW) generated the best model per forest metric. Overall, the DR data performed better at modelling structure variables, whilst the FW data performed better at modelling composition and deadwood variables. Neither showed a clear advantage at modelling variables from a particular vegetation layer (canopy, shrub or ground). Height, intensity/amplitude, and ITC-derived crown variables were shown to be important inputs across the best performing models (DR or FW), but the additional echo-width variables available from FW point data were relatively unimportant. Of perhaps greater significance to the choice between lidar data type (i.e. DR or FW) in determining the predictive power of the best performing models was the selection of leaf-on and/or leaf-off data. Of the 23 best models, 10 contained both leaf-on and leaf-off lidar variables, whilst 11 contained only leaf-on and two only leaf-off data. We therefore conclude that although FW lidar has greater vertical profile information than DR lidar, the greater complimentary information about the entire forest canopy profile that is available from both leaf-on and leaf-off data is of more benefit to forest inventory, in general, than the selection between DR or FW lidar.},

	abstract = {The relationship between tree height and diameter is fundamental in determining community and ecosystem structure as well as estimates of biomass and carbon storage. Yet our understanding of how tree allometry relates to climate and whole organismal function is limited. We used the Forest Inventory and Analysis National Program database to determine height-diameter allometries of 2,976,937 individuals of 293 tree species across the United States. The shape of the allometric relationship was determined by comparing linear and nonlinear functional forms. Mixed-effects models were used to test for allometric differences due to climate and floristic (between angiosperms and gymnosperms) and functional groups (leaf habit and shade tolerance). Tree allometry significantly differed across the United States largely because of climate. Temperature, and to some extent precipitation, in part explained tree allometric variation. The magnitude of allometric variation due to climate, however, had a phylogenetic signal. Specifically, angiosperm allometry was more sensitive to differences in temperature compared to gymnosperms. Most notably, angiosperm height was more negatively influenced by increasing temperature variability, whereas gymnosperm height was negatively influenced by decreasing precipitation and increasing altitude. There was little evidence to suggest that shade tolerance influenced tree allometry except for very shade-intolerant trees which were taller for any given diameter. Tree allometry is plastic rather than fixed and scaling parameters vary around predicted central tendencies. This allometric variation provides insight into life-history strategies, phylogenetic history, and environmental limitations at biogeographical scales. Tree height-diameter allometry is plastic and scaling parameters vary around predicted central tendencies due to climatic variation. The magnitude of allometric variation due to climate depends largely on differences between angiosperms and gymnosperms.},

Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) has proven useful for estimating carbon density patterns outside of field plot inventory networks. However, the accuracy and generality of calibrations between LiDAR-assisted ACD predictions (EACDLiDAR) and estimated ACD based on field inventory techniques (EACDfield) must be increased in order to make tropical forest carbon mapping more widely available. Using a network of 804 field inventory plots distributed across a wide range of tropical vegetation types, climates and successional states, we present a general conceptual and technical approach for linking tropical forest EACDfield to LiDAR top-of-canopy height (TCH) using regional-scale inputs of basal area and wood density. With this approach, we show that EACDLiDAR and EACDfield reach nearly 90\% agreement at 1-ha resolution for a wide array of tropical vegetation types. We also show that Lorey's Height - a common metric used to calibrate LiDAR measurements to biomass - is severely flawed in open canopy forests that are common to the tropics.

In this study, the fused airborne laser scanning (ALS) data and hyperspectral images were used to model and predict the total and species-specific volumes based on three forest inventory approaches, namely the individual tree crown (ITC) approach, the semi-ITC approach, and the area-based approach (ABA). The performances of these inventory approaches were analyzed and compared at the plot level in a complex Alpine forest in Italy. For the ITC and semi-ITC approaches, an ITC delineation algorithm was applied. With the ITC approach, the species-specific volumes were predicted with allometric models for each crown segment and aggregated to the total volume. For the semi-ITC and ABA, a multivariate k-most similar neighbor method was applied to simultaneously predict the total and species-specific volumes using leave-one-out cross-validation at the plot level. In both methods, the ALS and hyperspectral variables were important for volume modeling. The total volume of the ITC, semi-ITC, and ABA resulted in relative root mean square errors (RMSEs) of 25.31\%, 17.41\%, 30.95\% of the mean and systematic errors (mean differences) of 21.59\%, -0.27\%, and -2.69\% of the mean, respectively. The ITC approach achieved high accuracies but large systematic errors for minority species. For majority species, the semi-ITC performed slightly better compared to the ABA, resulting in higher accuracies and smaller systematic errors. The results indicated that the semi-ITC outperformed the two other inventory approaches. To conclude, we suggest that the semi-ITC method is further tested and assessed with attention to its potential in operational forestry applications, especially in cases for which accurate species-specific forest biophysical attributes are needed.},

Four key questions are addressed: (i) does full-waveform LiDAR provide advantages over discrete-return laser sensors; (ii) will full-waveform LiDAR provide valid results in support of forest inventory operations and allow for a decrease in ground sampling efforts; (iii) is the use of full-waveform LiDAR data cost effective; and (iv) what is the scope of the applied methods (i.e., is full-waveform LiDAR accurate for different forest compositions, structures, and densities, and is it sensitive to leaf-off/leaf-on conditions)? Key forest structure characteristics can be estimated with significant accuracy using full-waveform metrics, although methodologies and their corresponding accuracies differ. For example, some processing methods are valid at the plot scale, whereas other procedures perform well at the regional scale; to be effective, certain LiDAR data analyses require a minimum point density, whereas other methods perform well using large-footprint sensors. Therefore, it is important to match processing methods with the appropriate scale and scope.

	abstract = {To assess the diversity of tropical tree life histories, a conceptual framework is needed to guide quantitative comparative study of many species. We propose one such framework, which focuses on long-term performance through ontogeny and over the natural range of microsites. For 6 yr we annually evaluated survival, growth, and microsite conditions of six non-pioneer tree species in primary tropical wet forest at the La Selva Biological Station, Costa Rica. The species were: Lecythis ampla, Hymenolobium mesoamericanum, Dipteryx panamensis, Pithecellobium elegans, Hyeronima alchorneoides (all emergents), and Minquartia guianensis (a canopy species). The study was based on long-term measurement of individuals from all post-seedling size classes. Trees were sampled from 150 ha of primary forest spanning several watersheds and soil types. To evaluate individuals' microsites we recorded the number of overtopping crowns, forest phase (gap, building, mature), and crown illumination index (an estimate of the tree's light environment). For comparison, we also evaluated the microsites of three species that have been categorized as pioneers (Cecropia insignis, C. obtusifolia) or high-light demanders (Simarouba amara). For the six species of non-pioneers, mortality rates declined with increasing juvenile size class. As a group, these emergent and canopy trees showed a much lower exponential annual mortality rate (0.44\%/yr at {\textgreater} 10 cm diameter) than has been found for the La Selva forest as a whole. Growth rates increased with juvenile size class for all six species. As adults (trees {\textgreater}30 cm in diameter), all five emergent species showed substantial annual diameter increments (medians of 5-14 mm/yr). Small saplings and adults of all species had significant year-to-year variation in diameter growth, with much greater growth occurring in the year of lowest rainfall. Passage time analysis suggests that all six species require {\textgreater} 150 yr for growth from small saplings to the canopy. Evaluation of all nine species revealed four patterns of microsite occupancy by juveniles. Among the non-pioneers, one species pair (Lecythis and Minquartia: Group A) was associated with low crown illumination and mature-phase forest in all juvenile stages. For two species (Dipteryx and Hymenolobium: Group B) the smallest saplings were in predominantly low-light, mature-forest sites, but crown illumination and association with gap-or building-phase sites increased with juvenile size (Simarouba also showed this pattern). Two species (Pithecellobium and Hyeronima: Group C) were strongly associated with gap or building phase as small juveniles (≤4 cm diameter) and again as subcanopy trees ({\textgreater} 10-20 cm diameter), but were predominantly in mature-phase sites at intermediate sizes. Juveniles of the two pioneer species (Cecropia: Group D) showed the highest crown illumination and association with gap or building sites. Among the six non-pioneer species, only one aspect of juvenile performance clearly varied according to microsite group. The smallest saplings (≤ 1 cm diameter) of Groups B and C showed significant mortality differences across a small gradient in crown illumination; neither of the Group A species snowed this pattern. Otherwise, juvenile performance was strikingly similar among the six species. All showed a capacity for growth responses to small increases in light, substantial height and diameter increments at higher light levels, equal ability to survive 4-yr periods of no growth, and very low mortality rates at intermediate-to-large juvenile sizes. Species differed significantly in growth rates, but relative differences shifted with tree size and were unrelated to microsite group. These findings do not support prevailing paradigms concerning trade-offs and correlated suites of traits. For non-pioneer tropical trees, life history classification based on generalized concepts such as gap dependence and shade tolerance is inadequate to describe the complex size-dependent patterns of life history differences and similarities that exist among species.},

	abstract = {Insights into how terrestrial ecosystems affect the Earth's response to changes in climate and rising atmospheric CO2 levels rely heavily on the predictions of terrestrial biosphere models (TBMs). These models contain detailed mechanistic representations of biological processes affecting terrestrial ecosystems; however, their ability to simultaneously predict field-based measurements of terrestrial vegetation dynamics and carbon fluxes has remained largely untested. In this study, we address this issue by developing a constrained implementation of a new structured TBM, the Ecosystem Demography model version 2 (ED2), which explicitly tracks the dynamics of fine-scale ecosystem structure and function. Carbon and water flux measurements from an eddy-flux tower are used in conjunction with forest inventory measurements of tree growth and mortality at Harvard Forest (42.5°N, 72.1°W) to estimate a number of important but weakly constrained model parameters. Evaluation against a decade of tower flux and forest dynamics measurements shows that the constrained ED2 model yields greatly improved predictions of annual net ecosystem productivity, carbon partitioning, and growth and mortality dynamics of both hardwood and conifer trees. The generality of the model formulation is then evaluated by comparing the model's predictions against measurements from two other eddy-flux towers and forest inventories of the northeastern United States and Quebec. Despite the markedly different composition throughout this region, the optimized model realistically predicts observed patterns of carbon fluxes and tree growth. These results demonstrate how TBMs parameterized with field-based measurements can provide quantitative insight into the underlying biological processes governing ecosystem composition, structure, and function at larger scales.

	abstract = {An international data science challenge, called National Ecological Observatory Network—National Institute of Standards and Technology data science evaluation, was set up in autumn 2017 with the goal to improve the use of remote sensing data in ecological applications. The competition was divided into three tasks: (1) individual tree crown (ITC) delineation, for identifying the location and size of individual trees; (2) alignment between field surveyed trees and ITCs delineated on remote sensing data; and (3) tree species classification. In this paper, the methods and results of team Fondazione Edmund Mach (FEM) are presented. The ITC delineation (Task 1 of the challenge) was done using a region growing method applied to a near-infrared band of the hyperspectral images. The optimization of the parameters of the delineation algorithm was done in a supervised way on the basis of the Jaccard score using the training set provided by the organizers. The alignment (Task 2) between the delineated ITCs and the field surveyed trees was done using the Euclidean distance among the position, the height, and the crown radius of the ITCs and the field surveyed trees. The classification (Task 3) was performed using a support vector machine classifier applied to a selection of the hyperspectral bands and the canopy height model. The selection of the bands was done using the sequential forward floating selection method and the Jeffries Matusita distance. The results of the three tasks were very promising: team FEM ranked first in the data science competition in Task 1 and 2, and second in Task 3. The Jaccard score of the delineated crowns was 0.3402, and the results showed that the proposed approach delineated both small and large crowns. The alignment was correctly done for all the test samples. The classification results were good (overall accuracy of 88.1\%, kappa accuracy of 75.7\%, and mean class accuracy of 61.5\%), although the accuracy was biased toward the most represented species.},

The full-waveform point parameters amplitude, width, range corrected intensity and total number of targets within a beam are transferred into raster covering a test site of 10km2. It was possible to isolate the three most important variables based on the intensity, the width and the total number of targets.

	abstract = {It has been suggested that attempts to use remote sensing to map the spatial and structural patterns of individual tree species abundances in heterogeneous forests, such as those found in northeastern North America, may benefit from the integration of hyperspectral or multi-spectral information with other active sensor data such as lidar. Towards this end, we describe the integrated and individual capabilities of waveform lidar and hyperspectral data to estimate three common forest measurements - basal area (BA), above-ground biomass (AGBM) and quadratic mean stem diameter (QMSD) - in a northern temperate mixed conifer and deciduous forest. The use of this data to discriminate distribution and abundance patterns of five common and often, dominant tree species was also explored. Waveform lidar imagery was acquired in July 2003 over the 1000 ha. Bartlett Experimental Forest (BEF) in central New Hampshire (USA) using NASA's airborne Laser Vegetation Imaging Sensor (LVIS). High spectral resolution imagery was likewise acquired in August 2003 using NASA's Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS). Field data (2001-2003) from over 400 US Forest Service Northern Research Station (USFS NRS) plots were used to determine actual site conditions. Results suggest that the integrated data sets of hyperspectral and waveform lidar provide improved outcomes over use of either data set alone in evaluating common forest metrics. Across all forest conditions, 8-9\% more of the variation in AGBM, BA, and QMSD was explained by use of the integrated sensor data in comparison to either AVIRIS or LVIS metrics applied singly, with estimated error 5-8\% lower for these variables. Notably, in an analysis using integrated data limited to unmanaged forest tracts, AGBM coefficients of determination improved by 25\% or more, while corresponding error levels decreased by over 25\%. When data were restricted based on the presence of individual tree species within plots, AVIRIS data alone best predicted species-specific patterns of abundance as determined by species fraction of biomass. Nonetheless, use of LVIS and AVIRIS data - in tandem - produced complementary maps of estimated abundance and structure for individual tree species, providing a promising adjunct to traditional forest inventory and conservation biology planning efforts. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

	abstract = {Lidar remote sensing has emerged as one of the best technologies for mapping aboveground biomass in forest systems. Recent developments in lidar instruments, computer processing power, and algorithm development have enabled the mapping of individual tree structure from lidar remote sensing, yet the utility of individual tree metrics has not been fully explored for aboveground biomass mapping. Conversely, scaling-based approaches using minimal data inputs have recently been presented as an alternative method for mapping regional biomass. We compare these two emerging avenues of lidar-based biomass mapping to plot-aggregated biomass modeling techniques. We assess three forested ecosystems: a mature, closed-canopy deciduous broadleaf forest; a mature evergreen needleleaf forest; and a Loblolly pine plantation with a range of even-aged stands. For individual tree based approaches, individual tree metrics improve explanatory power from R$^{\textrm{2}}$=0.57 to R$^{\textrm{2}}$=0.85 in the mature conifer site, but do not show statistically significant improvements in the other two sites. We suggest that with large field sample plots in areas of open canopy cover, individual tree metrics can significantly improve aboveground biomass (AGBM) estimation as they directly take into account stand density. Regarding scaling-based approaches, we demonstrate that the proposed methods are currently unsuitable at local scales in forests without a tight relationship between canopy top height and basal area, as seen in two of our study areas. Individual tree information shows promise for improving AGBM modeling capabilities, and may also facilitate scaling-based approaches, but further research regarding the application of allometric equations and the spatial scale of models is necessary to continue advancing the field of high-resolution forest biomass accounting.},

	abstract = {This paper highlights a novel segmentation approach for single trees from LIDAR data and compares the results acquired both from first/last pulse and full waveform data. In a first step, a conventional watershed-based segmentation procedure is set up, which robustly interpolates the canopy height model from the LIDAR data and identifies possible stem positions of the tallest trees in the segments calculated from the local maxima of the canopy height model. Secondly, this segmentation approach is combined with a special stem detection method. Stem positions in the segments of the watershed segmentation are detected by hierarchically clustering points below the crown base height and reconstructing the stems with a robust RANSAC-based estimation of the stem points. Finally, a new three-dimensional (3D) segmentation of single trees is implemented using normalized cut segmentation. This tackles the problem of segmenting small trees below the canopy height model. The key idea is to subdivide the tree area in a voxel space and to set up a bipartite graph which is formed by the voxels and similarity measures between the voxels. Normalized cut segmentation divides the graph hierarchically into segments which have a minimum similarity with each other and whose members (= voxels) have a maximum similarity. The solution is found by solving a corresponding generalized eigenvalue problem and an appropriate binarization of the solution vector. Experiments were conducted in the Bavarian Forest National Park with conventional first/last pulse data and full waveform LIDAR data. The first/last pulse data were collected in a flight with the Falcon II system from TopoSys in a leaf-on situation at a point density of 10 points/m2. Full waveform data were captured with the Riegl LMS-Q560 scanner at a point density of 25 points/m2 (leaf-off and leaf-on) and at a point density of 10 points/m2 (leaf-on). The study results prove that the new 3D segmentation approach is capable of detecting small trees in the lower forest layer. So far, this has been practically impossible if tree segmentation techniques based on the canopy height model were applied to LIDAR data. Compared to a standard watershed segmentation procedure, the combination of the stem detection method and normalized cut segmentation leads to the best segmentation results and is superior in the best case by 12\%. Moreover, the experiments show clearly that using full waveform data is superior to using first/last pulse data. © 2009 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc. (ISPRS).},

Natural and anthropogenic disturbances have important and lasting influences on ecosystem structure and fluxes that can be difficult to detect or assess with conventional methods.

Airborne lidar remote sensing was used to measure spatial heterogeneity in the vertical structure of vegetation. The ecosystem demography model (ED) was used to estimate the consequences of this heterogeneity for regional estimates of carbon stocks and fluxes. Lidar data provided substantial constraints on model estimates of both carbon stocks and net carbon fluxes. Lidar-initialized ED estimates of aboveground biomass were within 1.2\% of regression-based approaches, and corresponding model estimates of net carbon fluxes differed substantially from bracketing alternatives. The results of this study provide a promising illustration of the power of combining lidar data on vegetation height with a height-structured ecosystem model. Extending these analyses to larger scales will require the development of regional and global lidar data sets, and the continued development and application of height structured ecosystem models.},

GFCL was estimated to be 1,011,000 km2 from 2000 to 2005, representing 3.1\% (0.6\% per year) of the year 2000 estimated total forest area of 32,688,000 km2. The boreal biome experienced the largest area of GFCL, followed by the humid tropical, dry tropical, and temperate biomes. GFCL expressed as the proportion of year 2000 forest cover was highest in the boreal biome and lowest in the humid tropics. Among continents, North America had the largest total area and largest proportion of year 2000 GFCL. At national scales, Brazil experienced the largest area of GFCL over the study period, 165,000 km2, followed by Canada at 160,000 km2. Of the countries with {\textgreater}1,000,000km2 of forest cover, the United States exhibited the greatest proportional GFCL and the Democratic Republic of Congo the least. Our results illustrate a pervasive global GFCL dynamic. However, GFCL represents only one component of net change, and the processes driving GFCL and rates of recovery from GFCL differ regionally. For example, the majority of estimated GFCL for the boreal biome is due to a naturally induced fire dynamic. To fully characterize global forest change dynamics, remote sensing efforts must extend beyond estimating GFCL to identify proximate causes of forest cover loss and to estimate recovery rates from GFCL.},

Here, we compile a global database of 108753 trees for which stem diameter, height and crown diameter have all been measured, including 2395 trees harvested to measure aboveground biomass. Using this database, we develop general allometric models for estimating both the diameter and aboveground biomass of trees from attributes which can be remotely sensed – specifically height and crown diameter. We show that tree height and crown diameter jointly quantify the aboveground biomass of individual trees and find that a single equation predicts stem diameter from these two variables across the world's forests.

Samples of trees and shrubs were collected between 4,200 and 4,600 m asl and analyzed using standard dendrochronological methods. Results evidenced that P. tarapacana is a slow-growing species since it grows less than 5 mm per year. Furthermore, elevation has a negative effect on radial growth. Morphometric models showed that a positive relationship between total height and diameter exists but not a significant relation between number of tree-rings and morphometry. Elevation had a major role in the radial growth of P. tarapacana which interacts with microclimatic conditions. Careful considerations should be made at the moment of using allometry as a surrogate for age in ecological studies. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2009.},

	abstract = {Full-waveform laser scanning data acquired with a Riegl LMS-Q560 instrument were used to classify an orange orchard into orange trees, grass and ground using waveform parameters alone. Gaussian decomposition was performed on this data capture from the National Airborne Field Experiment in November 2006 using a custom peak-detection procedure and a trust-region-reflective algorithm for fitting Gauss functions. Calibration was carried out using waveforms returned from a road surface, and the backscattering coefficient γ was derived for every waveform peak. The processed data were then analysed according to the number of returns detected within each waveform and classified into three classes based on pulse width and γ. For single-peak waveforms the scatterplot of γ versus pulse width was used to distinguish between ground, grass and orange trees. In the case of multiple returns, the relationship between first (or first plus middle) and last return γ values was used to separate ground from other targets. Refinement of this classification, and further sub-classification into grass and orange trees was performed using the γ versus pulse width scatterplots of last returns. In all cases the separation was carried out using a decision tree with empirical relationships between the waveform parameters. Ground points were successfully separated from orange tree points. The most difficult class to separate and verify was grass, but those points in general corresponded well with the grass areas identified in the aerial photography. The overall accuracy reached 91\%, using photography and relative elevation as ground truth. The overall accuracy for two classes, orange tree and combined class of grass and ground, yielded 95\%. Finally, the backscattering coefficient γ of single-peak waveforms was also used to derive reflectance values of the three classes. The reflectance of the orange tree class (0.31) and ground class (0.60) are consistent with published values at the wavelength of the Riegl scanner (1550. nm). The grass class reflectance (0.46) falls in between the other two classes as might be expected, as this class has a mixture of the contributions of both vegetation and ground reflectance properties. © 2013 The authors.},

Traditionally this has been accomplished using categorical representations such as plant functional types. Increasingly, plant functional ecologists have sought to refine categorical functional types via quantitative functional traits in order to understand the ecological implications of trade-offs in plant form and function. Fewer works have focused upon testing whether commonly measured functional traits enhance our understanding of plant biogeography broadly and the geographic distribution of vegetation types in particular. Here we combine a continental-scale forest inventory data set containing 18 111 plots with a plant functional trait data set to ask: (1) Is there a strong relationship between the abiotic environment and the distribution of functional trait values in forest inventory plots? And (2) can different Holdridge life zones be distinguished upon the basis of their functional trait distributions? The results show geographic patterns of functional trait distributions that are often strongly correlated with climate and also show that the Holdridge life zones in the study area can be differentiated using a combination of functional traits. © 2010 by the Ecological Society of America.},

	abstract = {Meso-scale digital terrain models (DTMs) and canopy-height estimates, or digital canopy models (DCMs), are two lidar products that have immense potential for research in tropical rain forest (TRF) ecology and management. In this study, we used a small-footprint lidar sensor (airborne laser scanner, ALS) to estimate sub-canopy elevation and canopy height in an evergreen tropical rain forest. A fully automated, local-minima algorithm was developed to separate lidar ground returns from overlying vegetation returns. We then assessed inverse distance weighted (IDW) and ordinary kriging (OK) geostatistical techniques for the interpolation of a sub-canopy DTM. OK was determined to be a superior interpolation scheme because it smoothed fine-scale variance created by spurious understory heights in the ground-point dataset. The final DTM had a linear correlation of 1.00 and a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 2.29 m when compared against 3859 well-distributed ground-survey points. In old-growth forests, RMS error on steep slopes was 0.67 m greater than on flat slopes. On flatter slopes, variation in vegetation complexity associated with land use caused highly significant differences in DTM error distribution across the landscape. The highest DTM accuracy observed in this study was 0.58-m RMSE, under flat, open-canopy areas with relatively smooth surfaces. Lidar ground retrieval was complicated by dense, multi-layered evergreen canopy in old-growth forests, causing DTM overestimation that increased RMS error to 1.95 m. A DCM was calculated from the original lidar surface and the interpolated DTM. Individual and plot-scale heights were estimated from DCM metrics and compared to field data measured using similar spatial supports and metrics. For old-growth forest emergent trees and isolated pasture trees greater than 20 m tall, individual tree heights were underestimated and had 3.67- and 2.33-m mean absolute error (MAE), respectively. Linear-regression models explained 51\% (4.15-m RMSE) and 95\% (2.41-m RMSE) of the variance, respectively. It was determined that improved elevation and field-height estimation in pastures explained why individual pasture trees could be estimated more accurately than old-growth trees. Mean height of tree stems in 32 young agroforestry plantation plots (0.38 to 18.53 m tall) was estimated with a mean absolute error of 0.90 m (r2=0.97; 1.08-m model RMSE) using the mean of lidar returns in the plot. As in other small-footprint lidar studies, plot mean height was underestimated; however, our plot-scale results have stronger linear models for tropical, leaf-on hardwood trees than has been previously reported for temperate-zone conifer and deciduous hardwoods. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

(2017), were evaluated in a tropical forest under sustainable forest management, situated in the State of Rondônia, Brazil. An automated tree matching procedure was developed in order to minimize the error when matching individual tree count from LiDAR and field data. In order to compare the four methods, results were expressed in recall, precision, and F score. Silva et al. (2016) outperformed the other methods, detecting 48\% of trees with 46\% of precision. Omission of trees was the leading source of error, caused primarily by overlapped trees in lower vegetation. However, errors of over-segmentation were relevant, caused by large and heterogeneous crowns that had multiple detections. Current canopy height model-based methods are ineffective to tropical forests, due to its complexity, which present a challenge for ITD algorithms. We believe that future studies that use complete 3D information from the point cloud, and multi-layer approaches should help to improve the accuracy of individual tree detection.},

In this paper, we present a system for the estimation of forest stem diameter and volume at individual tree level from multireturn light detection and ranging (LIDAR) data. The proposed system is made up of a preprocessing module, a LIDAR segmentation algorithm (aimed at retrieving tree crowns), a variable extraction and selection procedure, and an estimation module based on support vector regression (SVR) (which is compared with a multiple linear regression technique). The variables derived from LIDAR data are computed from both the intensity and elevation channels of all available returns. Three different methods of variable selection are analyzed, and the sets of variables selected are used in the estimation phase. The stem volume is estimated with two methods: 1) direct estimation from the LIDAR variables and 2) combination of diameters and heights estimated from LIDAR variables with the species information derived from a classification map according to standard height/diameter relationships. Experimental results show that the system proposed is effective and provides high accuracies in both the stem volume and diameter estimations. Moreover, this paper provides useful indications on the effectiveness of SVR with LIDAR in forestry problems. © 2011 IEEE.},

Although this method provides a simple and rapid approach, it can be subjective and needs to be calibrated against quantitative measurements of canopy structure. A study was undertaken in north-western Amazonia to provide a means to calibrate the CII in tropical forests. Hemispherical photographs were taken to represent each CII class, which were then analysed using HemiView 2.1 software in order to calculate light availability factors. The proportion of visible sky and indirect, direct and global site factors (the proportion of indirect, direct and total radiation reaching a point, compared to an open location) were all found to correlate strongly with CII class and therefore offer a viable method for calibration. CII classes could only be weakly defined with respect to leaf area index (LAI), however, and so conversion of CII to LAI or vice versa is problematic.

As this is often impractical, a number of surrogate measures have been developed that estimate light availability from assessments of forest canopy structure. 2. The subjective crown illumination index developed by Clark \& Clark (1992) was compared with Garrison's (1949) moosehorn and two new methods: (i) the crown illumination ellipses method, which compares the size of canopy gaps with a series of standard area ellipses printed on a transparent screen; and (ii) the canopy-scope that, like the moosehorn, uses an array of 25 dots printed on a transparent screen to assess canopy openness, but is more robust and portable, measuring the largest canopy gap visible from the point of measurement rather than canopy openness overhead. 3. The new measures were more highly correlated with canopy openness in the range 0-30\%, measured from hemispherical photographs, than the crown illumination index, and showed lower levels of between-observer variability. 4. The canopy-scope has the potential to be widely used for the simple and rapid assessment of forest understorey light environments. It has the advantage of giving ratio scale measurements that can be used in parametric statistics. The crown illumination ellipses can be used to score the illumination of crowns that are above head height.},

However, we lack a handy and open source tool that can be used by potential users for processing and analyzing FW LiDAR data. To this end, we introduce waveformlidar, an R package dedicated to FW LiDAR processing, analysis and visualization as a solution to the constraint. Specifically, this package provides several commonly used waveform processing methods such as Gaussian, Adaptive Gaussian and Weibull decompositions and deconvolution approaches (Gold and Richard-Lucy (RL)) with users' customized settings. In addition, we also developed functions to derive commonly used waveform metrics for characterizing vegetation structure. Moreover, a new way to directly visualize FW LiDAR data is developed by converting waveforms into points to form the Hyper Point Cloud (HPC), which can be easily adopted and subsequently analyzed with existing discrete-return LiDAR processing tools such as LAStools and FUSION. Basic explorations of the HPC such as 3D voxelization of the HPC and conversion from original waveforms to composite waveforms are also available in this package. All of these functions are developed based on small-footprint FW LiDAR data but they can be easily transplanted to the large footprint FW LiDAR data such as Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS) and Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) data analysis. It is anticipated that these functions will facilitate the widespread use of FW LiDAR and be beneficial for better estimating biomass and characterizing vegetation structure at various scales.},

	abstract = {LiDAR tells the user where surfaces are, not what they are. In this study we investigate the potential for waveform LiDAR to provide more information on the nature of the returns over forestry. Waveform LiDAR was acquired for ten Pinus radiata plots in a New Zealand plantation, along with comprehensive leaf area sampling in 2m vertical bands. The decay rate of each waveform peak was shown to be a useful tool for estimating foliage density, and has potential for identifying regions containing ground and understorey. Leaf Area Density (LAD) is an expression of foliage density per unit height, and a relationship between waveform decay rate and LAD was developed with an R2 of 56\%. Incorporating the proportion of discrete LiDAR that fell in that band (which itself has an R2 of 50\%) improves this model to explain 69\% of the variation in LAD. This is a good result, especially given the costs and difficulties in measuring leaf area directly. As foliage density varies dramatically on a fine scale it was not possible to differentiate the nature of every single LiDAR return – but by averaging over a small area local variation in LAD could be easily mapped. Ground returns could be distinguished as having short decays, and broad leafed understorey typically had values between those of the canopy and ground, although surface roughness and slope make it impossible to robustly identify single returns. This study produced a useful model for estimating LAD in Pinus radiata which could easily be extended to other coniferous species.},

	abstract = {Accurate estimation of above ground biomass (AGB) is required to better understand the variability and dynamics of tropical peat swamp forest (PSF) ecosystem function and resilience to disturbance events. The objective of this work is to examine the relationship between tropical PSF AGB and small-footprint airborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) discrete return (DR) and full waveform (FW) derived metrics, with a view to establishing the optimal use of this technology in this environment. The study was undertaken in North Selangor peat swamp forest (NSPSF) reserve, Peninsular Malaysia. Plot-based multiple regression analysis was performed to established the strongest predictive models of PSF AGB using DR metrics (only), FW metrics (only), and a combination of DR and FW metrics. Overall, the results demonstrate that a Combination-model, coupling the benefits derived from both DR and FW metrics, had the best performance in modelling AGB for tropical PSF (R2 = 0.77, RMSE = 36.4, rRMSE = 10.8\%); however, no statistical difference was found between the rRMSE of this model and the best models using only DR and FW metrics. We conclude that the optimal approach to using airborne LiDAR for the estimation of PSF AGB is to use LiDAR metrics that relate to the description of the mid-canopy. This should inform the use of remote sensing in this ecosystem and how innovation in LiDAR-based technology could be usefully deployed.},

	abstract = {Airborne LiDAR (Light Detection And Ranging) remote sensing for individual tree-level forest inventory necessitates proper extraction of individual trees and accurate measurement of tree structural parameters. Due to the inadequate tree finding capability offered by LiDAR technology and the complex patterns of forest canopies, significant omission and commission errors occur frequently in the segmentation results. Aimed at error reduction and accuracy refinement, this paper presents a novel adaptive mean shift-based clustering scheme aided by a tree trunk detection technique to segment individual trees and estimate tree structural parameters based solely on the airborne LiDAR data. Tree trunks are detected by analyzing points' vertical histogram to detach all potential crown points and then clustering the separated trunk points according to their horizontal mutual distances. The detected trunk information is used to adaptively calibrate the kernel bandwidth of the mean shift procedure in the fine segmentation stage by applying an original 2D (two-dimensional) estimation of individual crown diameters. Trunk detection results and LiDAR point clusters generated by the adaptive mean shift procedures serve as mutual references for final detection of individual trees. Experimental results show that a combination of adaptive mean shift clustering and detected tree trunk can provide a significant performance improvement in individual tree-level forest measurement. Compared with conventional clustering techniques, the trunk detection-aided mean shift clustering approach can detect 91.1\% of the trees ("recall") with a higher tree positioning accuracy (the mean positioning error is reduced by 33\%) in a multi-layered coniferous and broad-leaved mixed forest in South China, and 93.5\% of the identified trees are correct ("precision"). The tree detection brings the estimation of structural parameters for individual trees up to an accuracy level: -2.2\% mean relative error and 5.8\% relative RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) for tree height and 0.6\% mean relative error and 21.9\% relative RMSE for crown diameter, respectively.},

	abstract = {© 2018 Optical Society of America. Crown base height (CBH) is an essential tree biophysical parameter for many applications in forest management, forest fuel treatment, wildfire modeling, ecosystem modeling and global climate change studies. Accurate and automatic estimation of CBH for individual trees is still a challenging task. Airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) provides reliable and promising data for estimating CBH. Various methods have been developed to calculate CBH indirectly using regression-based means from airborne LiDAR data and field measurements. However, little attention has been paid to directly calculate CBH at the individual tree scale in mixed-species forests without field measurements. In this study, we propose a new method for directly estimating individual-tree CBH from airborne LiDAR data. Our method involves two main strategies: 1) removing noise and understory vegetation for each tree; and 2) estimating CBH by generating percentile ranking profile for each tree and using a spline curve to identify its inflection points. These two strategies lend our method the advantages of no requirement of field measurements and being efficient and effective in mixed-species forests. The proposed method was applied to a mixed conifer forest in the Sierra Nevada, California and was validated by field measurements. The results showed that our method can directly estimate CBH at individual tree level with a root-mean-squared error of 1.62 m, a coefficient of determination of 0.88 and a relative bias of 3.36\%. Furthermore, we systematically analyzed the accuracies among different height groups and tree species by comparing with field measurements. Our results implied that taller trees had relatively higher uncertainties than shorter trees. Our findings also show that the accuracy for CBH estimation was the highest for black oak trees, with an RMSE of 0.52 m. The conifer species results were also good with uniformly high R 2 ranging from 0.82 to 0.93. In general, our method has demonstrated high accuracy for individual tree CBH estimation and strong potential for applications in mixed species over large areas.},

Working within a lower montane floodplain-hillslope study site (750 m × 750 m) in the Upper Colorado River Basin, we developed a new data fusion framework, based on machine learning and feature engineering, that exploits remote sensing optical and light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data to estimate the distribution of key plant meadow communities at submeter resolution. We collected surface electrical resistivity tomography data to explore the variability in soil properties along a floodplain-hillslope transect at 0.50-m resolution and extracted LiDAR-derived metrics to model the rapid change in microtopography. We then investigated the covariability among the estimated plant community distributions, soil information, and topographic metrics. Results show that our framework estimated the distribution of nine plant communities with higher accuracy (87\% versus 80\% overall; 85\% versus 60\% for shrubs) compared to conventional classification approaches. Analysis of the covariabilities reveals a strong correlation between plant community distribution, soil electric conductivity, and slope, indicating that soil moisture is a primary control on heterogeneous spatial distribution. At the same time, microtopography plays an important role in creating particular ecosystem niches for some of the communities. Such relationships could be exploited to provide information about the spatial variability of soil properties. This highly transferable framework can be employed within long-term monitoring to capture community-specific physiological responses to perturbations, offering the possibility of bridging local plot-scale observations with large landscape monitoring.},

We use LiDAR remote sensing to isolate between 10,000 to more than 1,000,000 tree height and crown radius measurements per site in six U.S. forests. We find that fitted allometric parameters are highly sensitive to sample size, producing systematic overestimates of height. We extend our analysis to biomass through the application of empirical relationships from the literature, and show that given the small sample sizes used in common allometric equations for biomass, the average site-level biomass bias is ∼+70\% with a standard deviation of 71\%, ranging from-4\% to +193\%. These findings underscore the importance of increasing the sample sizes used for allometric equation generation.},

	abstract = {The ability to automatically delineate individual tree crowns using remote sensing data opens the possibility to collect detailed tree information over large geographic regions. While individual tree crown delineation (ITCD) methods have proven successful in conifer-dominated forests using Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data, it remains unclear how well these methods can be applied in deciduous broadleaf-dominated forests. We applied five automated LiDAR-based ITCD methods across fifteen plots ranging from conifer- to broadleaf-dominated forest stands at Harvard Forest in Petersham, MA, USA, and assessed accuracy against manual delineation of crowns from unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) imagery. We then identified tree- and plot-level factors influencing the success of automated delineation techniques. There was relatively little difference in accuracy between automated crown delineation methods (51-59\% aggregated plot accuracy) and, despite parameter tuning, none of the methods produced high accuracy across all plots (27-90\% range in plot-level accuracy). The accuracy of all methods was significantly higher with increased plot conifer fraction, and individual conifer trees were identified with higher accuracy (mean 64\%) than broadleaf trees (42\%) across methods. Further, while tree-level factors (e.g., diameter at breast height, height and crown area) strongly influenced the success of crown delineations, the influence of plot-level factors varied. The most important plot-level factor was species evenness, a metric of relative species abundance that is related to both conifer fraction and the degree to which trees can fill canopy space. As species evenness decreased (e.g., high conifer fraction and less efficient filling of canopy space), the probability of successful delineation increased. Overall, our work suggests that the tested LiDAR-based ITCD methods perform equally well in a mixed temperate forest, but that delineation success is driven by forest characteristics like functional group, tree size, diversity, and crown architecture. While LiDAR-based ITCD methods are well suited for stands with distinct canopy structure, we suggest that future work explore the integration of phenology and spectral characteristics with existing LiDAR as an approach to improve crown delineation in broadleaf-dominated stands.},

	abstract = {Full waveform lidar has a unique capability to characterise vegetation in more detail than any other practical method. The reflectance, calculated from the energy of lidar returns, is a key parameter for a wide range of applications and so it is vital to extract it accurately. Fifteen separate methods have been proposed to extract return energy (the amount of light backscattered from a target), ranging from simple to mathematically complex, but the relative accuracies have not yet been assessed. This paper uses a simulator to compare all methods over a wide range of targets and lidar system parameters. For hard targets the simplest methods (windowed sum, peak and quadratic) gave the most consistent estimates. They did not have high accuracies, but low standard deviations show that they could be calibrated to give accurate energy. This may be why some commercial lidar developers use them, where the primary interest is in surveying solid objects. However, simulations showed that these methods are not appropriate over vegetation. The widely used Gaussian fitting performed well over hard targets (0.24\% root mean square error, RMSE), as did the sum and spline methods (0.30\% RMSE). Over vegetation, for large footprint (15 m) systems, Gaussian fitting performed the best (12.2\% RMSE) followed closely by the sum and spline (both 12.7\% RMSE). For smaller footprints (33. cm and 1. cm) over vegetation, the relative accuracies were reversed (0.56\% RMSE for the sum and spline and 1.37\% for Gaussian fitting). Gaussian fitting required heavy smoothing (convolution with an 8 m Gaussian) whereas none was needed for the sum and spline. These simpler methods were also more robust to noise and far less computationally expensive than Gaussian fitting. Therefore it was concluded that the sum and spline were the most accurate for extracting return energy from waveform lidar over vegetation, except for large footprint (15 m), where Gaussian fitting was slightly more accurate. These results suggest that small footprint (≪ 15 m) lidar systems that use Gaussian fitting or proprietary algorithms may report inaccurate energies, and thus reflectances, over vegetation. In addition the effect of system pulse length, sampling interval and noise on accuracy for different targets was assessed, which has implications for sensor design.},

	abstract = {Waveform Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data have advantages over discrete-return LiDAR data in accurately characterizing vegetation structure. However, we lack a comprehensive understanding of waveform data processing approaches under different topography and vegetation conditions. The objective of this paper is to highlight a novel deconvolution algorithm, the Gold algorithm, for processing waveform LiDAR data with optimal deconvolution parameters. Further, we present a comparative study of waveform processing methods to provide insight into selecting an approach for a given combination of vegetation and terrain characteristics. We employed two waveform processing methods: (1) direct decomposition, (2) deconvolution and decomposition. In method two, we utilized two deconvolution algorithms – the Richardson-Lucy (RL) algorithm and the Gold algorithm. The comprehensive and quantitative comparisons were conducted in terms of the number of detected echoes, position accuracy, the bias of the end products (such as digital terrain model (DTM) and canopy height model (CHM)) from the corresponding reference data, along with parameter uncertainty for these end products obtained from different methods. This study was conducted at three study sites that include diverse ecological regions, vegetation and elevation gradients. Results demonstrate that two deconvolution algorithms are sensitive to the pre-processing steps of input data. The deconvolution and decomposition method is more capable of detecting hidden echoes with a lower false echo detection rate, especially for the Gold algorithm. Compared to the reference data, all approaches generate satisfactory accuracy assessment results with small mean spatial difference ({\textless}1.22 m for DTMs, {\textless}0.77 m for CHMs) and root mean square error (RMSE) ({\textless}1.26 m for DTMs, {\textless}1.93 m for CHMs). More specifically, the Gold algorithm is superior to others with smaller root mean square error (RMSE) ({\textless}1.01 m), while the direct decomposition approach works better in terms of the percentage of spatial difference within 0.5 and 1 m. The parameter uncertainty analysis demonstrates that the Gold algorithm outperforms other approaches in dense vegetation areas, with the smallest RMSE, and the RL algorithm performs better in sparse vegetation areas in terms of RMSE. Additionally, the high level of uncertainty occurs more on areas with high slope and high vegetation. This study provides an alternative and innovative approach for waveform processing that will benefit high fidelity processing of waveform LiDAR data to characterize vegetation structures.},

However, within relatively small catchments ({\textless}50. ha), differences in species composition induced by slight changes in elevation coupled with slope orientation, could result in sufficient canopy variability whereby throughfall hydrology would be definitively different across small gradients. This study aims to (1) quantify the differences in throughfall hydrology across small topographic gradients, (2) determine the variability of throughfall across such gradients, and (3) determine the seasonal effects on throughfall hydrology resulting from differences in species composition and growing niches.Throughfall partitioning was measured during 15 sampling periods at 4 landscape positions including 3 hillslopes with aspects facing north (NF), west (WF), and south (SF) in addition to a flat area (F) situated in the center of a 12. ha deciduous catchment. Throughfall partitioning was significantly lower on the steepest SF plot (TF = 75.0\%) than on the moderately sloping NF (TF = 83.9\%, p= 0.001) and F (TF = 81.7\%, p= 0.037) plots. SF also had the largest degree of throughfall variability (CV = 20.1), resulting from overlapping canopies, which led to higher rates of canopy interception. NF and WF plots exhibited the largest inter-seasonal differences with decreases in throughfall partitioning of 13.2\% (p= 0.013) and 12.1\% (p= 0.052), respectively, and corresponded to the largest differences in plant canopy indices (PAI) between seasons. Although slope and aspect were found to be distinguishing variables in our study, it was the influence of these variables on species composition that led to differences in throughfall quantity. Our study illustrates the systematic distribution of water resources across topographic positions within a relatively small forested catchment and highlights the need for additional consideration of topography-induced controls on microclimate and growing space, which ultimately influence water quality and quantity for effective management strategies.},

In the application of processing returned signal, the method of deconvolution has the unique advantages in extracting parameters of position, amplitude range and height. It has been widely used in spectroscopy, signal recovery, signal analysis, signal modeling and so on. In this study, deconvolution was used to remove the characteristic of the transmitted waveform form the received waveform to obtain a surface response. The simulated waveforms were used to investigate the potential of deconvolution in Full-waveform Lidar data analysis. The results showed that the Gold's method of deconvolution was suitable for solving the problem. ©2010 IEEE.},

The aim in this study was to predict individual-tree height (Ht; m), basal area (BA; m2), and stem volume (V; m3) attributes, imputing Random Forest k-nearest neighbor (RF k-NN) and individual-tree-level-based metrics extracted from a LiDAR-derived canopy height model (CHM) in a longleaf pine (Pinus palustris Mill.) forest in southwestern Georgia, United States. We developed a new framework for modeling tree-level forest attributes that comprise 3 steps: (i) individual tree detection, crown delineation, and tree-level-based metrics computation from LiDAR-derived CHM; (ii) automatic matching of LiDAR-derived trees and field-based trees for a regression modeling step using a novel algorithm; and (iii) RF k-NN imputation modeling for estimating tree-level Ht, BA, and V and subsequent summarization of these metrics at the plot and stand levels. RMSDs for tree-level Ht, BA, and V were 2.96\%, 58.62\%, and 8.19\%, respectively. Although BA estimation accuracy was poor because of the longleaf pine growth habitat, individual-tree locations, Ht, and V were estimated with high accuracy, especially in low-canopy-cover conditions. Future efforts based on the findings could help improve the estimation accuracy of individual-tree-level attributes such as BA.},

Because soil moisture influences are highly variable at the landscape scale, most meteorological datasets are not detailed enough to depict spatial trends in the water balance at these extents. We propose a tactical approach to gather high-resolution field data for use in soil moisture models. Using these data, we (1) describe general soil moisture trends for a 6400 ha watershed in the Oregon Western Cascades, USA (2) use this description to identify environmental variables to stratify across in collecting data for a statistical explanatory model of soil moisture spatial pattern at the onset of seasonal drought, and (3) examine the spatial scale of variability in soil moisture measurements compared to the scale of variability in potential explanatory factors. The results indicate that soil moisture dynamics and controls are different for different soil depths across this mountainous watershed. Soil moisture variability exhibits complex spatial patterns that can be partially estimated (up to 50 percent of the variation accounted) with easily measurable climatic and terrain variables. The analysis incorporates both macroscale (climate) and mesoscale (topographic drainage and radiation) influences on the water balance. Without additional data on the distribution of edaphic and biotic factors, we are not able to model the variability of soil moisture at the microscale. The regression approach can be used to extrapolate field measurements across similar topographic areas to examine spatial patterns in forest vegetation and moisture-controlled ecological processes.},

	abstract = {Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) systems are frequently used in ecological studies to measure vegetation canopy structure. Waveform LiDAR systems offer new capabilities for vegetation modelling by measuring the time-varying signal of the laser pulse as it illuminates different elements of the canopy, providing an opportunity to describe the 3D structure of vegetation canopies more fully. This article provides a comparison between waveform airborne laser scanning (ALS) data and discrete return ALS data, using terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) data as an independent validation. With reference to two urban landscape typologies, we demonstrate that discrete return ALS data provided more biased and less consistent measurements of woodland canopy height (in a 100\% tree covered plot, height underestimation bias = 0.82 m; sd = 1.78 m) than waveform ALS data (height overestimation bias = −0.65 m; sd = 1.45 m). The same biases were found in suburban data (in a plot consisting of 100\% hard targets e.g. roads and pavements), but discrete return ALS were more consistent here than waveform data (sd = 0.57 m compared to waveform sd = 0.76 m). Discrete return ALS data performed poorly in describing the canopy understorey, compared to waveform data. Our results also highlighted errors in discrete return ALS intensity, which were not present with waveform data. Waveform ALS data therefore offer an improved method for measuring the three-dimensional structure of vegetation systems, but carry a higher data processing cost. New toolkits for analysing waveform data will expedite future analysis and allow ecologists to exploit the information content of waveform LiDAR.},

This paper aims at presenting a survey of the literature related to such techniques, with emphasis on the new sensors called full-waveform lidar systems. Indeed, an emitted laser pulse interacts with complex natural and man-made objects leading to a temporal distortion of the returned energy profile. The new technology of full-waveform laser scanning systems permits one to digitize the complete waveform of each backscattered pulse. Full-waveform lidar data give more control to an end user in the interpretation process of the physical measurement and provide additional information about the structure and the physical backscattering characteristics of the illuminated surfaces. In this paper, the theoretical principles of full-waveform airborne laser scanning are first described. Afterwards, a review of the main sensors as well as signal processing techniques are presented.

	abstract = {In recent years, the availability of airborne imaging spectroscopy (hyperspectral) data has expanded dramatically. The high spatial and spectral resolution of these data uniquely enable spatially explicit ecological studies including species mapping, assessment of drought mortality and foliar trait distributions. However, we have barely begun to unlock the potential of these data to use direct mapping of vegetation characteristics to infer subsurface properties of the critical zone. To assess their utility for Earth systems research, imaging spectroscopy data acquisitions require integration with large, coincident ground-based datasets collected by experts in ecology and environmental and Earth science. Without coordinated, well-planned field campaigns, potential knowledge leveraged from advanced airborne data collections could be lost. Despite the growing importance of this field, documented methods to couple such a wide variety of disciplines remain sparse. We coordinated the first National Ecological Observatory Network Airborne Observation Platform (AOP) survey performed outside of their core sites, which took place in the Upper East River watershed, Colorado. Extensive planning for sample tracking and organization allowed field and flight teams to update the ground-based sampling strategy daily. This enabled collection of an extensive set of physical samples to support a wide range of ecological, microbiological, biogeochemical and hydrological studies. We present a framework for integrating airborne and field campaigns to obtain high-quality data for foliar trait prediction and document an archive of coincident physical samples collected to support a systems approach to ecological research in the critical zone. This detailed methodological account provides an example of how a multi-disciplinary and multi-institutional team can coordinate to maximize knowledge gained from an airborne survey, an approach that could be extended to other studies. The coordination of imaging spectroscopy surveys with appropriately timed and extensive field surveys, along with high-quality processing of these data, presents a unique opportunity to reveal new insights into the structure and dynamics of the critical zone. To our knowledge, this level of co-aligned sampling has never been undertaken in tandem with AOP surveys and subsequent studies utilizing this archive will shed considerable light on the breadth of applications for which imaging spectroscopy data can be leveraged.},

	abstract = {There is compelling evidence from glacial and interglacial periods of the Quaternary of the utilization of microrefugia. Microrefugia are sites that support locally favorable climates amidst unfavorable regional climates, which allow populations of species to persist outside of their main distributions. Knowledge of the location of microrefugia has important implications for climate change research as it will influence our understanding of the spatial distribution of species through time, their patterns of genetic diversity, and potential dispersal rates in response to climate shifts. Indeed, the implications of microrefugia are profound and yet we know surprisingly little about their climatic basis; what climatic processes can support their subsistence, where they may occur, their climatic traits, and the relevance of these locations for climate change research. Here I examine the climatic basis for microrefugia and assert that the interaction between regional advective influences and local terrain influences will define the distribution and nature of microrefugia. I review the climatic processes that can support their subsistence and from this climatic basis: (1) infer traits of the spatial distribution of microrefugia and how this may change through time; (2) review assertions about their landscape position and what it can tell us about regional climates; and (3) demonstrate an approach to forecasting where microrefugia may occur in the future.

Here we present a relatively low-cost, repeatable method for spatially parsing the landscape to help the U.S. Forest Service manage for different forest and fuel conditions to meet multiple goals relating to sensitive species, fuels reduction, forest products, water, carbon storage, and ecosystem restoration. Using the Kings River area of the Sierra Nevada as a case study, we create areas of topographically-based units, Landscape Management Units (LMUs) using a three by three matrix (canyon, mid-slope, ridge-top and northerly, southerly, and neutral aspects). We describe their size, elevation, slope, aspect, and their difference in inherent wetness and solar radiation. We assess the predictive value and field applicability of LMUs by using existing data on stand conditions and two sensitive wildlife species. Stand conditions varied significantly between LMUs, with canyons consistently having the greatest stem and snag densities. Pacific fisher (Martes pennanti) activity points (from radio telemetry) and California spotted owl (Strix occidentalis occidentalis) nests, roosts, and sightings were both significantly different from uniform, with a disproportionate number of observations in canyons, and fewer than expected on ridge-tops. Given the distinct characteristics of the LMUs, these units provide a relatively simple but ecologically meaningful template for managers to spatially allocate forest treatments, thereby meeting multiple National Forest objectives. These LMUs provide a framework that can potentially be applied to other fire-dependent western forests with steep topographic relief. © 2010 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Vegetation pattern on landscapes is the manifestation of physical gradients, biotic response to these gradients, and disturbances. Here we focus on the physical template as it governs the distribution of mixed-conifer forests in California's Sierra Nevada. We extended a forest simulation model to examine montane environmental gradients, emphasizing factors affecting the water balance in these summer-dry landscapes. The model simulates the soil moisture regime in terms of the interaction of water supply and demand: supply depends on precipitation and water storage, while evapotranspirational demand varies with solar radiation and temperature. The forest cover itself can affect the water balance via canopy interception and evapotranspiration. We simulated Sierran forests as slope facets, defined as gridded stands of homogeneous topographic exposure, and verified simulated gradient response against sample quadrats distributed across Sequoia National Park. We then performed a modified sensitivity analysis of abiotic factors governing the physical gradient. Importantly, the model's sensitivity to temperature, precipitation, and soil depth varies considerably over the physical template, particularly relative to elevation. The physical drivers of the water balance have characteristic spatial scales that differ by orders of magnitude. Across large spatial extents, temperature and precipitation as defined by elevation primarily govern the location of the mixed conifer zone. If the analysis is constrained to elevations within the mixed-conifer zone, local topography comes into play as it influences drainage. Soil depth varies considerably at all measured scales, and is especially dominant at fine (within-stand) scales. Physical site variables can influence soil moisture deficit either by affecting water supply or water demand; these effects have qualitatively different implications for forest response. These results have clear implications about purely inferential approaches to gradient analysis, and bear strongly on our ability to use correlative approaches in assessing the potential responses of montane forests to anthropogenic climatic change.},

This special issue contains papers that use a variety of remote sensing technologies to derive forest inventory or inventory-related information. Herein, we review the potential of 4 advanced remote sensing technologies, which we posit as having the greatest potential to influence forest inventories designed to characterize forest resource information for strategic, tactical, and operational planning: airborne laser scanning (ALS), terrestrial laser scanning (TLS), digital aerial photogrammetry (DAP), and high spatial resolution (HSR)/very high spatial resolution (VHSR) satellite optical imagery. ALS, in particular, has proven to be a transformative technology, offering forest inventories the required spatial detail and accuracy across large areas and a diverse range of forest types.

Individual tree crowns (ITCs) are the building blocks of precision forestry, because this knowledge allows users to analyze, model and manage the forest at the individual tree level by combing multiple data sources (e.g., remote sensing data and field surveys). Trees in the forest compete with other vegetation, especially neighboring trees, for limited resources to grow into the available horizontal and vertical space. Based on this assumption, this research developed a new region growing method that began with treetops as the initial seeds, and then segmented the ITCs, considering its growth space between the tree and its neighbors. The growth space was allocated by Euclidian distance and adjusted based on the crown size. Results showed that the over-segmentation accuracy (Oa), under-segmentation (Ua), and quality rate (QR) reached 0.784, 0.766, and 0.382, respectively, if the treetops were detected from a variable window filter based on an allometric equation for crown width. The Oa, Ua, and QR increased to 0.811, 0.853, and 0.296, respectively, when the treetops were manually adjusted. Treetop detection accuracy has a great impact on ITCs delineation accuracy. The uncertainties and limitations within this research including the interpretation error and accuracy measures were also analyzed and discussed, and a unified framework assessing the segmentation accuracy was highly suggested.},

	abstract = {An approach to distributed modeling of watershed hydro-ecological processes over large spatial scales is described. A data and simulation system, RHESSys (Regional HydroEcological Simulation System), combines a set of remote sensing/GIS techniques with integrated hydrological and ecological models in order to automate the parameterization and simulation of a suite of ecological and hydrological flux and storage processes through the watershed. Specifically, we simulate forest canopy net photosynthesis (PSN) and total evapotranspiration (ET) through the year with a modeling package that integrates FORESTBGC, a stand level model of forest carbon, water and nitrogen budgets, with TOPMODEL, a quasi-distributed hydrological model. The latter model introduces the effects of hillslope hydrological processes, incorporating surface redistribution of soil water by saturated throughflow processes. The maintainance of regular patterns of soil water by throughflow processes cause forest ecosystem activity to vary dependent on hillslope position. The distributed framework is based on a terrain partition in which each terrain object (hillslopes and stream reaches) comprising the watershed are separately parameterized and simulated. The location of each terrain object within the watershed is explicitly represented while the internal variability of each object is represented as a joint parameter distribution. Generalization of the surface into different numbers of terrain objects (by growing or shrinking the extent of the stream network) is automatically accomplished using digital terrain data. This allows us to flexibly alter the spatial representation of the watershed by shifting surface information either into the internal hillslope parameter distributions or into greater numbers of hillslopes (and stream reaches). Limited simulations of a mountainous watershed in western Montana indicate that incorporation of within hillslope throughflow and the soil, topography and vegetation distribution has the effect of significantly altering the seasonal PSN and ET trends in comparison with lumped surface representations without lateral water flux. © 1993.},

Field-estimated traits were generated from three community-weighting methods, and remotely sensed estimates of traits were made at three scales defined by sampling grain size and ecological extent. Field and remote sensing approaches revealed increases in average leaf mass per unit area (LMA), water, nonstructural carbohydrates (NSCs) and polyphenols with increasing elevation. Foliar nutrients and photosynthetic pigments displayed little to no elevation trend. Sample weighting approaches had little impact on field-estimated trait responses to elevation. Plot representativeness of trait distributions at landscape scales decreased with increasing elevation. Remote sensing indicated elevation-dependent increases in trait variance and distributional skew. Multiscale invariance of LMA, leaf water and NSC mark these traits as candidates for tracking forest responses to changing climate.

Lidar and synthetic-aperture Radar are promising remote-sensing-based techniques for obtaining comprehensive measurements of forest structure at regional to global scales. In this study we investigate how Lidar-derived forest heights and Radar-derived aboveground biomass can be used to constrain the dynamics of the ED2 terrestrial biosphere model. Four-year simulations initialized with Lidar and Radar structure variables were compared against simulations initialized from forest-inventory data and output from a longterm potential-vegtation simulation. Both height and biomass initializations from Lidar and Radar measurements significantly improved the representation of forest structure within the model, eliminating the bias of too many large trees that arose in the potential-vegtationinitialized simulation. The Lidar and Radar initializations decreased the proportion of larger trees estimated by the potential vegetation by ∼20-30\%, matching the forest inventory. This resulted in improved predictions of ecosystem-scale carbon fluxes and structural dynamics compared to predictions from the potential-vegtation simulation. The Radar initialization produced biomass values that were 75\% closer to the forest inventory, with Lidar initializations producing canopy height values closest to the forest inventory. Net primary production values for the Radar and Lidar initializations were around 6-8\% closer to the forest inventory. Correcting the Lidar and Radar initializations for forest composition resulted in improved biomass and basal-area dynamics as well as leaf-area index. Correcting the Lidar and Radar initializations for forest composition and fine-scale structure by combining the remote-sensing measurements with ground-based inventory data further improved predictions, suggesting that further improvements of structural and carbon-flux metrics will also depend on obtaining reliable estimates of forest composition and accurate representation of the fine-scale vertical and horizontal structure of plant canopies. © 2011 by the Ecological Society of America.},

Two stochastic modeling techniques, random forests (RF) and stochastic gradient boosting (SGB), are compared. The objectives of this study were first to explore the sensitivity of RF and SGB to choices in tuning parameters and, second, to compare the performance of the two final models by assessing the importance of, and interaction between, predictor variables, the global accuracy metrics derived from an independent test set, as well as the visual quality of the resultant maps of tree canopy cover. The predictive accuracy of RF and SGB was remarkably similar on all four of our pilot regions. In all four study regions, the independent test set mean squared error (MSE) was identical to three decimal places, with the largest difference in Kansas where RF gave an MSE of 0.0113 and SGB gave an MSE of 0.0117. With correlated predictor variables, SGB had a tendency to concentrate variable importance in fewer variables, whereas RF tended to spread importance among more variables. RF is simpler to implement than SGB, as RF has fewer parameters needing tuning and also was less sensitive to these parameters. As stochastic techniques, both RF and SGB introduce a new component of uncertainty: repeated model runs will potentially result in different final predictions. We demonstrate how RF allows the production of a spatially explicit map of this stochastic uncertainty of the final model.},

This vast scope and complexity, while warranted by the problems LSMs are designed to solve, has led to enormous challenges in understanding and attributing differences between LSM predictions. Meanwhile, the wide range of spatial scales that govern land surface heterogeneity, and the broad spectrum of timescales in land surface dynamics, create challenges in tractably representing processes in LSMs. We identify three “grand challenges” in the development and use of LSMs, based around these issues: managing process complexity, representing land surface heterogeneity, and understanding parametric dynamics across the broad set of problems asked of LSMs in a changing world.

Objectives included comparing the performance of Landsat 7- and 8-derived inputs separately and combined in mapping tree height at a regional scale, assessing the relative value of good observation counts and different Landsat spectral inputs for tree height estimation across a range of environments, and describing tree height distributions and discontinuities in Sub-Saharan Africa. A total of 5371 images were processed and per pixel quality assessed to create a set of multi-temporal metrics for the 2013 and 2014 calendar years for Landsat 7 only, Landsat 8 only and both Landsat 7 and 8 combined. Differences in performance were slight between different sensor inputs. However, performance generally improved with increasing numbers of good observations. Metrics derived from red reflectance data contributed most in estimating tree height. The regression tree algorithm accurately reproduced the LiDAR-derived height training data with an overall mean absolute error (MAE) for tree height estimation of 2.45 m using integrated Landsat 7 and 8 data. Significant underestimations were quantified for tall tree cover (MAE of 4.65 m for {\textgreater} 20 m heights) and overestimations for low/no tree cover (MAE 1.61 for {\textless} 5 m heights). Resulting tree distributions were found to be discontinuous with a primary dry seasonal woodlands cluster of 5–10 m in height, a second cluster of primarily dry evergreen forest tree cover from 11–17 m, and a third cluster of humid evergreen forest tree cover ≥ 18 m.

We used site water balance (actual evapotranspiration and climatic water deficit) and topography (slope position, slope, and insolation) as environmental predictors. Random forest modeling showed that environmental conditions predicted substantial portions of the variations in fire and forest structure: e.g., 85-93\% of the variation in whether a location did not burn, burned once, or burned twice; 64\% of the variation in the burn severity; and 72\% of the variation in canopy cover {\textgreater}2. m for unburned forests, 64\% for once-burned forests, and 59\% for twice-burned forests. Environmental conditions also predicted a substantial portion of forest structure following one and two fires, even though the post-fire forest structures were substantially different than pre-fire structures. This suggests a feedback mechanism in which local fire regimes and pre-fire forest structures are related to local environments, and their interaction produces post-fire structures also related to local environments. Among environmental predictors, water balance had the greatest explanatory power, followed by slope position, and then by slope and insolation. Managers could use our methods to help select reference areas that match environmental conditions, identify areas at risk for fires that endanger critical habitat or other resources, and identify climate analog areas to help anticipate and plan for climate change.},

Longitudinal data sets contribute greatly to our understanding, complementing experimental, modeling, and chronosequence approaches. Changing climate is changing forests, perhaps most rapidly through altered mortality regimes, and the elusive nature of integrated mechanistic understanding requires refinements and extensions to historically productive protocols. Changing climate reduces the inferential power of chronosequence techniques and changes model parameterization, and only some of the different factors contributing to tree mortality are expected to respond to climate variability and change. Because annual tree mortality rates are 5\% to 1\% for trees ≥ 1 cm dbh in young and old forests (respectively), detecting changes in mortality rates requires tracking thousands of trees, particularly to examine rare sub-populations of concern (e.g., large-diameter trees). And because mortality factors can be spatially aggregated and density-dependent, the causes and rates of tree mortality depend on the relationships between forest spatial structure and the direct and indirect effects of climate. Permanent plots with a combination of larger size, higher spatial precision, and greater sampling frequency will be required to further elucidate spatially explicit aspects of western forest demography. The combination of the longitudinal protocols developed by the Smithsonian Center for Tropical Forest Science, originally for studying tropical forest species diversity, and those developed by the US Geological Survey for annual tree mortality assessment together uniquely allow robust investigation of climate-mediated change in temperate forests.},

            The importance of soil age as an ecosystem driver across biomes remains largely unresolved. By combining a cross-biome global field survey, including data for 32 soil, plant, and microbial properties in 16 soil chronosequences, with a global meta-analysis, we show that soil age is a significant ecosystem driver, but only accounts for a relatively small proportion of the cross-biome variation in multiple ecosystem properties. Parent material, climate, vegetation and topography predict, collectively, 24 times more variation in ecosystem properties than soil age alone. Soil age is an important local-scale ecosystem driver; however, environmental context, rather than soil age, determines the rates and trajectories of ecosystem development in structure and function across biomes. Our work provides insights into the natural history of terrestrial ecosystems. We propose that, regardless of soil age, changes in the environmental context, such as those associated with global climatic and land-use changes, will have important long-term impacts on the structure and function of terrestrial ecosystems across biomes.},

Although we can predict the resistivity variation across the watershed, regions of smaller variability in the input parameters are shown to provide better estimates, highlighting the limitation of commonly applied geomorphological models.

The soil-landscape model, on which the soil survey is based, is an operative paradigm. An extreme reliance on tacit knowledge, the knowledge gained by experience, creates serious inefficiencies, both in learning the soillandscape paradigm and in disseminating the information resulting from its application. This article introduces concepts important to understanding paradigm theory and the nature of tacit knowledge. Among these are elements of Gestalt psychology, the theory of natural families, maps as conveyors of knowledge, and the linguistic nature of human perception. Students and field soil scientists should be provided explicit instruction concerning the paradigm on which soil mapping and interpretation are based. I also recommend that more of the soil geographic relationships discovered while making detailed soil maps be described and published so that the knowledge can be communicated to others.},

Accurate, high-resolution spatial information of SOM and CEC are needed for precision farm management. The objectives of this study were to: (1) map SOM and CEC in a low relief area using only lidar elevation-based terrain attributes, and (2) compare the prediction accuracy of SOM and CEC maps created by universal kriging, Cubist, and random forest with Soil Survey Geographic (SSURGO) database. For this study, 174 soil samples were collected from a depth from 0 to 10 cm. The topographic wetness index, topographic position index, multi resolution valley bottom ﬂatness, and multi resolution ridge top ﬂatness indices generated from the lidar data were used as covariates in model predictions. No major differences were found in the prediction performance of all selected models. For SOM, the predictive models provided results with coefﬁcient of determination (R2) (0.44–0.45), root mean square error (RMSE) (0.8–0.83\%), bias (0–0.22\%), and concordance correlation coefﬁcient (ρc) (0.56–0.58). For CEC, the R2 ranged from 0.39 to 0.44, RMSE ranged from 3.62 to 3.74 cmolc kg−1, bias ranged from 0–0.17 cmolc kg−1, and ρc ranged from 0.55 to 0.57. We also compared the results to the USDA Soil Survey Geographic (SSURGO) data. For both SOM and CEC, SSURGO was comparable with our predictive models, except for few map units where both SOM and CEC were either under or over predicted.},

	abstract = {Statistical validation of spatial predictions of soil properties requires assessment of errors against measured values. The objective of this study was to assess the size of errors in the measurement of soil pH from different sources in the United States of America national databases and implications of the size of errors for prediction, validation and management decision making under uncertain conditions. Error sources included measurement methods, laboratory conditions, pedotransfer functions, database manipulations, location accuracy, and spatial and polygon methods of interpolation. The databases consisted of measured soil pH values from the US National Cooperative Soil Survey Characterization Database (NCSS–SCDB) and estimated values from US Soil Survey Geographic (SSURGO) and State Soil Geographic (STATSGO2) databases. The degree of agreement between measurement methods ranged from poor to substantial, with Lin’s concordance correlation coefficients (𝜌c) varying from 0.83 (pH 1:1W against 1:5CaCl2) to 0.95 (pH 1:1W against pH 1:5W) and root mean square error (RMSE) varying from 0.27 to 0.43. The degree of agreement between pH 1:1W, 1:2CaCl2 and mid-infrared spectroscopy (MIR) ranged from poor to moderate. The RMSE for MIR was 0.40 for pH 1:1W and 0.32 for soil pH 1:2CaCl2. The RMSE for between-laboratory reproducibility varied from 0.50 (pH 1:1W) to 0.68 (pH 1:2CaCl2) and was greater than within-laboratory reproducibility (pH 1:1W, 0.34; pH 1:2 CaCl2, 0.22) and repeatability (pH 1:1W, 0.19; pH 1:2CaCl2, 0.04). The RMSE for the relations for profile depth slicing (weighted mean against equal-area spline) was 0.36. The RMSE for the relation between soil pH 1:1W for the Global Positioning System and Public Land Survey System was 0.57. Predictions based on polygon or spatial interpolation had the largest RMSEs, 0.78 and 0.62, respectively. Soil liming recommendations based on 0.1 pH increments do not reflect error measurements or the uncertainty of spatial prediction. Although it was not possible to establish consistent trends in the size of error (progressively increasing from measurement to aggregation), its assessment can improve modelling and management at various scales.},

It also affects the growing season’s start and end, and plant access to moisture and nutrients. Here, we review the current knowledge of the snow cover’s role for vegetation, plant-animal interactions, permafrost conditions, microbial processes, and biogeochemical cycling. We also compare studies of natural snow gradients with snow experimental manipulation studies to assess time scale difference of these approaches. The number of tundra snow studies has increased considerably in recent years, yet we still lack a comprehensive overview of how altered snow conditions will affect these ecosystems. Specifically, we found a mismatch in the timing of snowmelt when comparing studies of natural snow gradients with snow manipulations. We found that snowmelt timing achieved by snow addition and snow removal manipulations (average 7.9 days advance and 5.5 days delay, respectively) were substantially lower than the temporal variation over natural spatial gradients within a given year (mean range 56 days) or among years (mean range 32 days). Differences between snow study approaches need to be accounted for when projecting snow dynamics and their impact on ecosystems in future climates.},

	abstract = {Accurate estimation of tree biomass is necessary to provide realistic values of the carbon stored in the terrestrial biosphere. A recognized source of errors in tree aboveground biomass (AGB) estimation is introduced when individual tree height values (H) are not directly measured but estimated from diameter at breast height (DBH) using allometric equations. In this paper, we evaluate the performance of 12 alternative DBH : H equations and compare their effects on AGB estimation for three tropical forests that occur in contrasting climatic and altitudinal zones. We found that fitting a three-p­ arameter Weibull function using data collected locally generated the lowest errors and bias in H estimation, and that equations fitted to these data were more accurate than equations with parameters derived from the literature. For computing AGB, the introduced error values differed notably among DBH : H allometric equations, and in most cases showed a clear bias that resulted in either over-­or under-­estimation of AGB. Fitting the three-p­ arameter Weibull function minimized errors in AGB estimates in our study and we recommend its widespread adoption for carbon stock estimation. We conclude that many previous studies are likely to present biased estimates of AGB due to the method of H estimation.},

	abstract = {Overstory forest structure responds to terrain-related abiotic factors and to biotic interactions among overstory and understory plants. Unlike species abundance, tree height, biomass, and leaf area in many regions have been poorly quantiﬁed in relation to terrain-driven environmental gradients. In addition, the magnitude of understory inﬂuences on overstory structure has been poorly characterized for many forest systems. Our primary goal was to identify relationships between terrain (elevation, convexity, exposure), evergreen understory, and overstory structure (height, aboveground biomass, leaf area) in mature deciduous forests of the southern Appalachian Mountains. We used a combination of ﬁeld point and plot measurements, LiDAR, and satellite image data to sample little-disturbed deciduous forest stands. Height, biomass, and gap frequency were signiﬁcantly related to changes in elevation, exposure (aspect), and convexity (cove to ridge). Higher evergreen understory density was strongly correlated with decreases in forest height and biomass, with an impact observed across moisture, elevation, and exposure gradients. Canopies on ridges averaged half as tall at the highest evergreen understory densities when compared to those without evergreen shrubs (10 vs. 19 m), and overstory canopy height averaged 6 m shorter on sideslopes with high evergreen understory density compared to those with low evergreen understory density. Canopy height declined from low to high elevations, with larger relative decreases on ridges, but biomass increased from low to high elevations, due primarily to high biomass in coves at midto upper elevations. Biomass and canopy height declined from cove to ridge and north- to south-facing slopes. Responses in canopy height and aboveground biomass associated with changes in understory evergreen density were similar to impacts due to terrain. Gaps were more frequent on south-facing slopes. Previous studies at this site and others identify soil moisture and soil N competition as the most plausible mechanisms by which understory shrubs might inﬂuence overstory canopy structure, with low light limiting seedling recruitment as an additional mechanism. Our work suggests evergreen understory density, particularly on sideslope and ridge locations, substantially affects overstory canopy height and biomass.},

	abstract = {In ﬁre-adapted conifer forests of the Western U.S., changing land use has led to increased forest densities and fuel conditions partly responsible for increasing the extent of high-severity wildﬁres in the region. In response, land managers often use mechanical thinning treatments to reduce fuels and increase overstory structural complexity, which can help improve stand resilience and restore complex spatial patterns that once characterized these stands. The outcomes of these treatments can vary greatly, resulting in a large gradient in aggregation of residual overstory trees. However, there is limited information on how a range of spatial outcomes from restoration treatments can inﬂuence structural complexity and tree regeneration dynamics in mixed conifer stands. In this study, we model understory light levels across a range of forest density in a stem-mapped dry mixed conifer forest and apply this model to simulated stem maps that are similar in residual basal area yet vary in degree of spatial complexity. We found that light availability was best modeled by residual stand density index and that consideration of forest structure at multiple spatial scales is important for predicting light availability. Second, we found that restoration treatments diﬀering in spatial pattern may diﬀer markedly in their achievement of objectives such as density reduction, maintenance of horizontal and tree size complexity, and creation of microsite conditions favorable to shade-intolerant species, with several notable tradeoﬀs. These conditions in turn have cascading eﬀects on regeneration dynamics, treatment longevity, ﬁre behavior, and resilience to disturbances. In our study, treatments with high aggregation of residual trees best balanced multiple objectives typically used in ponderosa pine and dry mixed conifer forests. Simulation studies that consider a wide range of possible spatial patterns can complement ﬁeld studies and provide predictions of the impacts of mechanical treatments on a large range of potential ecological eﬀects.},

These databases were: (1) Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA), (2) NRCS Soil Survey Geographic (SSURGO), and (3) Rapid Carbon Assessment (RaCA). We compared estimates of SOC density and concentration among databases and analyzed relationships between key soil properties and SOC densities and concentrations. Estimates of SOC density to a 20 cm depth which allows comparison among all three databases were 77 ± 1.2 Mg ha−1, 95 ± 0.3 Mg ha−1, and 39 ± 2.2 Mg ha−1 for SSURGO, RaCA, and FIA, respectively. Significant differences existed among databases in SOC density at shallow depth increments, and marked differences existed among databases in the soil depths measured. Analysis of the influence of soil texture and drainage class on SOC highlighted the importance of silt and clay in SOC retention. A hypothetical increase in forest and agricultural SOC was compared to reported Maine GHG emissions to illustrate potential policy implications in the use of soil databases. We conclude that all three databases are valuable but not interchangeable. The database should be carefully chosen to match the objectives of the user.},

            Climate change is anticipated to increase the frequency and intensity of droughts, with major impacts to ecosystems globally. Broad-scale assessments of vegetation responses to drought are needed to anticipate, manage, and potentially mitigate climate-change effects on ecosystems. We quantified the drought sensitivity of vegetation in the Pacific Northwest, USA, as the percent reduction in vegetation greenness under droughts relative to baseline moisture conditions. At a regional scale, shrub-steppe ecosystems—with drier climates and lower biomass—showed greater drought sensitivity than conifer forests. However, variability in drought sensitivity was considerable within biomes and within ecosystems and was mediated by landscape topography, climate, and soil characteristics. Drought sensitivity was generally greater in areas with higher elevation, drier climate, and greater soil bulk density. Ecosystems with high drought sensitivity included dry forests along ecotones to shrublands, Rocky Mountain subalpine forests, and cold upland sagebrush communities. In forests, valley bottoms and areas with low soil bulk density and high soil available water capacity showed reduced drought sensitivity, suggesting their potential as drought refugia. These regional-scale drought-sensitivity patterns discerned from remote sensing can complement plot-scale studies of plant physiological responses to drought to help inform climate-adaptation planning as drought conditions intensify.},

A quantitative expression of the geometric shape of the land surface (terrain shape index) is described and correlated with overstory tree heights and site quality. Application of the index in three even-aged stands of yellow-popular (Liriodendron tulipifera L.) on high-quality uniform sites shows that it is highly correlated with total height of trees in a stand, with r2 ranging from 0.45 to 0.74. In comparisons among stands, the index accounted for an average of 51\% of the variation in site index. The relationship was validated in two supplementary stands and accounted for about 49\% of variation in site index. The terrain shape index was more accurate in predicting tree height than was lateral shape class, a subjective measure of slope shape occasionally used in soil-site studies. For. Sci. 35(1):91-104.},

In a test with data from four locations, site index of yellow-poplar (Liriodendrontulipifera L.) was significantly correlated with landform index for each location (r = 0.45–0.65). Landform index and two other topographic variables together accounted for 31 percent of the variation in yellow-poplar site index throughout the Blue Ridge province.

We studied six long-term chronosequences, in Australia, Sweden, Alaska, Hawaii, and New Zealand; for each, the decline phase was associated with a reduction in tree basal area and an increase in the substrate nitrogen–to-phosphorus ratio, indicating increasing phosphorus limitation over time. These changes were often associated with reductions in litter decomposition rates, phosphorus release from litter, and biomass and activity of decomposer microbes. Our findings suggest that the maximal biomass phase reached during succession cannot be maintained in the long-term absence of major disturbance, and that similar patterns of decline occur in forested ecosystems spanning the tropical, temperate, and boreal zones.},

Extreme droughts often lead to more common and more intense forest ﬁres, causing dramatic changes in the nutrient storage and loss from forest ecosystems. Changes in the future manifestation of drought will affect carbon uptake and storage in forests, leading to feedbacks to the Earth’s climate system.

	abstract = {As light detection and ranging (LiDAR) technology advances, it has become common for datasets to be acquired at a point density high enough to capture structural information from individual trees. To process these data, an automatic method of isolating individual trees from a LiDAR point cloud is required. Traditional methods for segmenting trees attempt to isolate prominent tree crowns from a canopy height model. We here introduce a novel segmentation method, layer stacking, which slices the entire forest point cloud at 1-m height intervals and isolates trees in each layer. Merging the results from all layers produces representative tree profiles. When compared to watershed delineation (a widely used segmentation algorithm), layer stacking correctly identified 15\% more trees in unevenaged conifer stands, 7\%–17\% more in even-aged conifer stands, 26\% more in mixedwood stands, and 26\%–30\% more (with 75\% of trees correctly detected) in pure deciduous stands. Overall, layer stacking’s commission error was mostly similar to or better than that of watershed delineation. Layer stacking performed particularly well in deciduous, leaf-off conditions, even those where tree crowns were less prominent. We conclude that in the tested forest types, layer stacking represents an improvement in segmentation when compared to existing algorithms.},

Two terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) units (FARO s350 (phase shift, PS) and RIEGL vz-2000 (time of ﬂight, TOF)) were assessed in a series of laboratory experiments to determine if lidar can be used to estimate the moisture content of dead forest litter. Samples consisted of two control materials, the angle and position of which could be manipulated (pine boards and cheesecloth), and four single-species forest litter types (Douglas-ﬁr needles, ponderosa pine needles, longleaf pine needles, and southern red oak leaves). Sixteen sample trays of each material were soaked overnight, then allowed to air dry with scanning taking place at 1 h, 2 h, 4 h, 8 h, 12 h, and then in 12 h increments until the samples reached equilibrium moisture content with the ambient relative humidity. The samples were then oven-dried for a ﬁnal scanning and weighing. The spectral reﬂectance values of each material were also recorded over the same drying intervals using a ﬁeld spectrometer. There was a strong correlation between the intensity and standard deviation of intensity per sample tray and the moisture content of the dead leaf litter. A multiple linear regression model with a break at 100\% gravimetric moisture content produced the best model with R2 values as high as 0.97. This strong relationship was observed with both the TOF and PS lidar units. At fuel moisture contents greater than 100\% gravimetric water content, the correlation between the pulse intensity values recorded by both scanners and the fuel moisture content was the strongest. The relationship deteriorated with distance, with the TOF scanner maintaining a stronger relationship at distance than the PS scanner. Our results demonstrate that lidar can be used to detect and quantify fuel moisture across a range of forest litter types. Based on our ﬁndings, lidar may be used to quantify fuel moisture levels in near real-time and could be used to create spatial maps of wildland fuel moisture content.},

	abstract = {Subalpine ﬁr mortality complex has caused signiﬁcant damage to high elevation forests within Colorado. For the past two decades the climate of spruce-ﬁr forests has trended towards being warmer and drier, which indirectly aﬀects subalpine ﬁr mortality. We examined potential links among abiotic (i.e. deviations in temperature and precipitation), biotic [Armillaria root disease (Armillaria spp.), Western balsam bark beetle (Dryocoetes confusus), a black stain fungus (Ophiostoma dryocoetidis)] and forest structure factors with mortality in subalpine ﬁr (Abies lasiocarpa) and Engelmann spruce (Picea engelmannii) dominated forests of Colorado. Sampling was performed in two separate ﬁeld surveys: 1. Statewide characterization plots and 2. Stand health monitoring plots. The statewide characterization plots were compared to aerial surveys and to establish suitable locations for stand health plots. Stand health monitoring plots collected direct measurements of abiotic and biotic factors aﬀecting forests, with an emphasis on identifying the presence of D. confusus and Armillaria spp. The objectives of this study were to determine: (1) Is spruce-ﬁr morality observed at ground level similar to that estimated through aerial surveys? (2) Is the presence dead subalpine ﬁr and Englemann spruce on a plot associated with site and stand characteristics?, (3) What factors are associated with the incidence of Armillaria spp., Dr. confusus, and Dendroctonus ruﬁpennis?, and (4) Do trends in warming temperatures and reductions in precipitation in the past ﬁve years inﬂuence subalpine ﬁr mortality and/or the presence of biotic agents? Our results suggested that the presence of biotic agents (Dr. confusus, De. ruﬁpennis, Armillaria spp., and O. dryocoetidis) and stand density are associated with spruce-ﬁr mortality, whereas climatic factors had a direct association to the presence of Armillaria and were indirectly associated with mortality via Dr. confusus. Increasing maximum summer temperatures were found to be associated with the presence of Armillaria spp. The climatic variables investigated in this study did not signiﬁcantly link to incidence of Dr. confusus, yet stand density was associated with increasing prevalence of Dr. confusus. The presence of Armillaria spp. and Dr. confusus were signiﬁcantly related to tree decline, but several other factors are also associated with subalpine ﬁr mortality, suggesting complex interactions of abiotic and biotic factors are likely involved. We hypothesized that increasing stand density, drought and the presence of Dr. confusus and Armillaria spp. are threatening Colorado spruce-ﬁr forests. Understanding the factors that are involved in subalpine ﬁr mortality are important for management.},

This novel NSC method showed accurate and rapid in individual tree segmentation using point cloud data. The K-nearest neighbour-based sampling (KNNS) was proposed for the Nyström approximation of voxels to improve the eﬃciency. The NSC algorithm showed good performance for 32 plots in China and Europe. The overall matching rate and extraction rate of proposed algorithm reached 69\% and 103\%. For all trees located by Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) calibrated tape-measures, the tree height regression of the matching results showed an value of 0.88 and a relative root mean square error (RMSE) of 5.97\%. For all trees located by GNSS calibrated total-station measures, the values were 0.89 and 4.49\%.

	abstract = {Tall trees and vertical forest structure are associated with increased productivity, biomass and wildlife habitat quality. While climate has been widely hypothesized to control forest structure at broad scales, other variables could be key at ﬁne scales, and are associated with forest management. In this study we identify the environmental conditions (climate, topography, soils) associated with increased tree height across spatial scales using airborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data to measure canopy height. The study was conducted over a large elevational gradient from 200 to 3000 m in the Sierra Nevada Mountains (CA, USA) spanning sparse oak woodlands to closed canopy conifer forests. We developed Generalized Boosted Models (GBMs) of forest height, ranking predictor variable importance against Maximum Canopy Height (CHMax) at six spatial scales (25, 50, 100, 250, 500, 1000 m). In our study area, climate variables such as the climatic water deﬁcit and mean annual precipitation were more strongly correlated with CHmax (18–52\% relative importance) than soil and topographic variables, and models at intermediate (50–500 m) scales explained the most variance in CHMax (R2 0.77–0.83). Certain soil variables such as soil bulk density and pH, as well as topographic variables such as the topographic wetness index, slope curvature and potential solar radiation, showed consistent, strong associations with canopy structure across the gradient, but these relationships were scale dependent. Topography played a greater role in predicting forest structure at ﬁne spatial scales, while climate variables dominated our models, particularly at coarse scales. Our results indicate that multiple abiotic factors are associated with increased maximum tree height; climatic water balance is most strongly associated with this component of forest structure but varies across all spatial scales examined (6.9–54.8\% relative importance), while variables related to topography also explain variance in tree height across the elevational gradient, particularly at ﬁner spatial scales (37.15\%, 20.26\% relative importance at 25, 50 m scales respectively).},

	abstract = {Above‐ground biomass in forests is critical to the global carbon cycle as it stores and sequesters carbon from the atmosphere. Climate change will disrupt the carbon cycle hence understanding how climate and other abiotic variables determine forest biomass at broad spatial scales is important for validating and constraining Earth System models and predicting the impacts of climate change on forest carbon stores. We examined the importance of climate and soil variables to explaining above‐ground biomass distribution across the Australian continent using publicly available biomass data from 3130 mature forest sites, in 6 broad ecoregions, encompassing tropical, subtropical and temperate biomes. We used the Random Forest algorithm to test the explanatory power of 14 abiotic variables (8 climate, 6 soil) and to identify the best‐performing models based on climate‐only, soil‐only and climate plus soil. The best performing models explained {\textasciitilde}50\% of the variation (climate‐only: R
              2
               = 0.47 ± 0.04, and climate plus soils: R
              2
               = 0.49 ± 0.04). Mean temperature of the driest quarter was the most important climate variable, and bulk density was the most important soil variable. Climate variables were consistently more important than soil variables in combined models, and model predictive performance was not substantively improved by the inclusion of soil variables. This result was also achieved when the analysis was repeated at the ecoregion scale. Predicted forest above‐ground biomass ranged from 18 to 1066 Mg ha
              −1
              , often under‐predicting measured above‐ground biomass, which ranged from 7 to 1500 Mg ha
              −1
              . This suggested that other non‐climate, non‐edaphic variables impose a substantial influence on forest above‐ground biomass, particularly in the high biomass range. We conclude that climate is a strong predictor of above‐ground biomass at broad spatial scales and across large environmental gradients, yet to predict forest above‐ground biomass distribution under future climates, other non‐climatic factors must also be identified.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Resource managers need spatially explicit models of hydrologic response to changes in key climatic drivers across variable landscape conditions. We demonstrate the utility of a Basin Characterization Model for California (CA-BCM) to integrate high-resolution data on physical watershed characteristics with historical or projected climate data to predict watershed-specific hydrologic responses.
Methods: The CA-BCM applies a monthly regional water-balance model to simulate hydrologic responses to climate at the spatial resolution of a 270-m grid. The model has been calibrated using a total of 159 relatively unimpaired watersheds for the California region.
Results: As a result of calibration, predicted basin discharge closely matches measured data for validation watersheds. The CA-BCM recharge and runoff estimates, combined with estimates of snowpack and timing of snowmelt, provide a basis for assessing variations in water availability. Another important output variable, climatic water deficit, integrates the combined effects of temperature and rainfall on site-specific soil moisture, a factor that plants may respond to more directly than air temperature and precipitation alone. Model outputs are calculated for each grid cell, allowing results to be summarized for a variety of planning units including hillslopes, watersheds, ecoregions, or political boundaries.
Conclusions: The ability to confidently calculate hydrologic outputs at fine spatial scales provides a new suite of hydrologic predictor variables that can be used for a variety of purposes, such as projections of changes in water availability, environmental demand, or distribution of plants and habitats. Here we present the framework of the CA-BCM model for the California hydrologic region, a test of model performance on 159 watersheds, summary results for the region for the 1981–2010 time period, and changes since the 1951–1980 time period.},

            Mountain forests face significant threats from global change and spatio-temporal variation in tree height can help to monitor these effects. While tree height is typically measured through field inventories, remote sensing can provide accurate and extensive forest structure data. In this study, we used the Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation space-borne laser sensor (GEDI
            )
            to examine the relationship between maximum tree height and elevation, temperature, and precipitation in the main European mountain ranges. We found a non-linear relationship between elevation and maximum tree height in all mountain ranges, supporting the existence of a common breakpoint that marks the beginning of the tree development limitation. Temperature and precipitation were identified as the most important drivers of tree height variation. Additionally, we predicted significant upward displacement of the breakpoint under climate change scenarios, potentially increasing the area without growth limitations for trees. However, the displacement of the breakpoint may not align with the movement of the treeline, impacting on alpine ecosystems. These findings contribute to understanding the impacts of global warming on mountain forest ecosystems and provide insights for their monitoring and managing.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Evaluating the environmental impacts of climate change on water resources and biological components of the landscape is an integral part of hydrologic and ecological investigations, and the resultant land and resource management in the twenty-first century. Impacts of both climate and simulated hydrologic parameters on ecological processes are relevant at scales that reflect the heterogeneity and complexity of landscapes. At present, simulations of climate change available from global climate models [GCMs] require downscaling for hydrologic or ecological applications.
Methods: Using statistically downscaled future climate projections developed using constructed analogues, a methodology was developed to further downscale the projections spatially using a gradient-inverse-distancesquared approach for application to hydrologic modeling at 270-m spatial resolution.
Results: This paper illustrates a methodology to downscale and bias-correct national GCMs to subkilometer scales that are applicable to fine-scale environmental processes. Four scenarios were chosen to bracket the range of future emissions put forth by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Fine-scale applications of downscaled datasets of ecological and hydrologic correlations to variation in climate are illustrated.
Conclusions: The methodology, which includes a sequence of rigorous analyses and calculations, is intended to reduce the addition of uncertainty to the climate data as a result of the downscaling while providing the fine-scale climate information necessary for ecological analyses. It results in new but consistent data sets for the US at 4 km, the southwest US at 270 m, and California at 90 m and illustrates the utility of fine-scale downscaling to analyses of ecological processes influenced by topographic complexity.},

              Declines in the number of large trees in temperate and tropical forests have attracted attention, given their disproportionate importance to forest structure, function, and carbon storage. Yet, factors responsible for these declines are unclear. By comparing historic (1930s) and contemporary (2000s) surveys of California forests, we document that across 120,000 km
              2
              , large trees have declined by up to 50\%, corresponding to a 19\% decline in average basal area and associated biomass, despite large increases in small tree density. Contemporary forests also exhibit increased dominance by oaks over pines. Both large tree declines and increased oak dominance were associated with increases in climatic water deficit, suggesting that water stress may be contributing to changes in forest structure and function across large areas.
            
          , 
            We document changes in forest structure between historical (1930s) and contemporary (2000s) surveys of California vegetation through comparisons of tree abundance and size across the state and within several ecoregions. Across California, tree density in forested regions increased by 30\% between the two time periods, whereas forest biomass in the same regions declined, as indicated by a 19\% reduction in basal area. These changes reflect a demographic shift in forest structure: larger trees ({\textgreater}61 cm diameter at breast height) have declined, whereas smaller trees ({\textless}30 cm) have increased. Large tree declines were found in all surveyed regions of California, whereas small tree increases were found in every region except the south and central coast. Large tree declines were more severe in areas experiencing greater increases in climatic water deficit since the 1930s, based on a hydrologic model of water balance for historical climates through the 20th century. Forest composition in California in the last century has also shifted toward increased dominance by oaks relative to pines, a pattern consistent with warming and increased water stress, and also with paleohistoric shifts in vegetation in California over the last 150,000 y.},

Filtering for local maximum with circular windows gave better ﬁtting models for pines, while for deciduous trees, ﬁltering with square windows provided a slightly better model ﬁt.

              Logging, pervasive across the lowland tropics, affects millions of hectares of forest, yet its influence on nutrient cycling remains poorly understood. One hypothesis is that logging influences phosphorus (P) cycling, because this scarce nutrient is removed in extracted timber and eroded soil, leading to shifts in ecosystem functioning and community composition. However, testing this is challenging because P varies within landscapes as a function of geology, topography and climate. Superimposed upon these trends are compositional changes in logged forests, with species with more acquisitive traits, characterized by higher foliar P concentrations, more dominant. It is difficult to resolve these patterns using traditional field approaches alone. Here, we use airborne light detection and ranging‐guided hyperspectral imagery to map foliar nutrient (i.e. P, nitrogen [N]) concentrations, calibrated using field measured traits, over 400 km
              2
              of northeastern Borneo, including a landscape‐level disturbance gradient spanning old‐growth to repeatedly logged forests. The maps reveal that canopy foliar P and N concentrations decrease with elevation. These relationships were not identified using traditional field measurements of leaf and soil nutrients. After controlling for topography, canopy foliar nutrient concentrations were lower in logged forest than in old‐growth areas, reflecting decreased nutrient availability. However, foliar nutrient concentrations and specific leaf area were greatest in relatively short patches in logged areas, reflecting a shift in composition to pioneer species with acquisitive traits. N:P ratio increased in logged forest, suggesting reduced soil P availability through disturbance. Through the first landscape scale assessment of how functional leaf traits change in response to logging, we find that differences from old‐growth forest become more pronounced as logged forests increase in stature over time, suggesting exacerbated phosphorus limitation as forests recover.},

Following high-severity fire, forest recovery may be compromised by lack of tree seed sources, warmer and drier postfire climate, or short-interval reburning. A potential outcome of the loss of resilience is the conversion of the prefire forest to a different forest type or nonforest vegetation. Conversion implies major, extensive, and enduring changes in dominant species, life forms, or functions, with impacts on ecosystem services. In the present article, we synthesize a growing body of evidence of fire-driven conversion and our understanding of its causes across western North America. We assess our capacity to predict conversion and highlight important uncertainties. Increasing forest vulnerability to changing fire activity and climate compels shifts in management approaches, and we propose key themes for applied research coproduced by scientists and managers to support decision-making in an era when the prefire forest may not return.},

                  Canopy height is a key factor that affects carbon storage, vegetation productivity and biodiversity in forests, as well as an indicator of key processes such as biomass allocation. However, global variation in forest canopy height and its determinants are poorly known.
                
                
                  
                    We used global data on Light Detection and Ranging‐derived maximum forest canopy height (
                    H
                    max
                    ) to test hypotheses relating
                    H
                    max
                    to current climate (water availability, ambient energy and water–energy dynamics), regional evolutionary and biogeographic history, historical climate change, and human disturbance.
                  
                
                
                  
                    We derived
                    H
                    max
                    for 32 304 forested 55‐km grid cells using 1‐km global canopy height data (maximum height of 1‐km cells within a 55‐km grid). Variation in
                    H
                    max
                    was related to latitude and biomes, along with environmental and historical variables. Both spatial and non‐spatial linear models were used to assess the relative importance of the different hypothesized factors.
                  
                
                
                  
                    H
                    max
                    was inversely related to latitude (i.e. tall canopies at the equator), but with high geographical variability. Actual evapotranspiration and annual precipitation were the factors most correlated to
                    H
                    max
                    globally, thus supporting the water–energy dynamics hypothesis. However, water limitation emerged as a key factor in tropical and temperate biomes within specific geographic regions, while energy limitation was a more important factor in boreal regions where temperature is more limiting to trees than water.
                  
                
                
                  
                    H
                    max
                    exhibited strong variation among biogeographic regions, supporting the role of regional evolutionary and biogeographic history in structuring broad‐scale patterns in canopy height. Furthermore, there were divergent relationships between climate and
                    H
                    max
                    between the Southern and Northern Hemispheres, consistent with historical evolutionary contingencies modulating these relationships. Historical climate change was also related to
                    H
                    max
                    , albeit not as strongly, with shorter canopy heights where late‐Quaternary climate has been less stable. In contrast, human disturbance was only weakly related to
                    H
                    max
                    at the scale (55 km) examined here.
                  
                
                
                  
                    Synthesis
                    . This study confirms that forest canopy height is strongly controlled by current climate, but also provides evidence for an important supplementary role for regional–historical factors. This highlights the importance of considering evolutionary and biogeographic history for achieving a comprehensive understanding of forest ecosystem properties.},

              1.
               Plant height is a central part of plant ecological strategy. It is strongly correlated with life span, seed mass and time to maturity, and is a major determinant of a species’ ability to compete for light. Plant height is also related to critical ecosystem variables such as animal diversity and carbon storage capacity. However, remarkably little is known about global patterns in plant height. Here, we use maximum height data for 7084 plant Species × Site combinations to provide the first global, cross‐species quantification of the latitudinal gradient in plant height.
            
            
              2.
               The mean maximum height of species growing within 15° of the equator (7.8 m) was 29 times greater than the height of species between 60° and 75° N (27 cm), and 31 times greater than the height of species between 45° and 60° S (25 cm). There was no evidence that the latitudinal gradient in plant height was different in the northern hemisphere than in the southern hemisphere (
              P 
              =
               
              0.29). A 2.4‐fold drop in plant height at the edge of the tropics (
              P 
              =
               
              0.006) supports the idea that there might be a switch in plant strategy between temperate and tropical zones.
            
            
              3.
               We investigated 22 environmental variables to determine which factors underlie the latitudinal gradient in plant height. We found that species with a wide range of height strategies were present in cold, dry, low productivity systems, but there was a noticeable lack of very short species in wetter, warmer, more productive sites. Variables that capture information about growing conditions during the harsh times of the year were relatively poor predictors of height. The best model for global patterns in plant height included only one term: precipitation in the wettest month (
              R
              2
               = 0.256).

              Synthesis
              . We found a remarkably steep relationship between latitude and height, indicating a major difference in plant strategy between high and low latitude systems. We also provide new, surprising information about the correlations between plant height and environmental variables.},

Recently lidar has seen a dramatic widening of applications in the natural sciences, resulting in technological improvements and an increase in the availability of both airborne and ground-based sensors. Modern sensors allow mapping of vegetation heights and snow or ground surface elevations below forest canopies. Typical vertical accuracies for airborne datasets are decimeter-scale with order 1 m point spacings. Ground-based systems typically provide millimeter-scale range accuracy and sub-meter point spacing over 1 m to several kilometers. Many system parameters, such as scan angle, pulse rate and shot geometry relative to terrain gradients, require specification to achieve specific point coverage densities in forested and/or complex terrain. Additionally, snow has a significant volumetric scattering component, requiring different considerations for error estimation than for other Earth surface materials. We use published estimates of light penetration depth by wavelength to estimate radiative transfer error contributions. This paper presents a review of lidar mapping procedures and error sources, potential errors unique to snow surface remote sensing in the near-infrared and visible wavelengths, and recommendations for projects using lidar for snow-depth mapping.},

Here we describe and present results from the Airborne Snow Observatory (ASO), a coupled imaging spectrometer and scanning lidar, combined with distributed snow modeling, developed for the measurement of snow spectral albedo/broadband albedo and snow depth/ SWE. Snow density is simulated over the domain to convert snow depth to SWE. The result presented in this paper is the ﬁrst operational application of remotely sensed snow albedo and depth/SWE to quantify the volume of water stored in the seasonal snow cover.

To address this question we fuse continuous tree density estimates derived from hyperspatial remote sensing imagery (pixels smaller than trees) with two topographically derived environmental gradients: elevation and yearly potential relative radiation (PRR). We based our analysis on the maximum tree density found in each of over 200 environmental gradient combinations found with our area of interest, drawing from a dataset consisting of over 300,000 30 m plots and over 3 million individual trees. At a given elevation, sites in which maximum tree density increases as a function of increasing yearly PRR were considered to be temperature or energy limited. Conversely, sites in which maximum tree density decreased as a function of increasing yearly PRR were considered water limited. We found that eastern Lake Tahoe appears to be a landscape which is both water limited (at lower elevation and brighter, south-facing slopes) and temperature/energy limited (at higher elevations and darker, north-facing slopes). We discuss how fusing accurate and ecologically relevant remote sensing outputs with direct and indirect continuous microclimate surfaces can provide a powerful tool for addressing major questions of tree distributions and life history parameters.},

	abstract = {Mountainous topography creates ﬁne-scale environmental mosaics that vary in precipitation, temperature, insolation, and slope position. This mosaic in turn inﬂuences fuel accumulation and moisture and forest structure. We studied these the effects of varying environmental conditions across a 27,104 ha landscape within Yosemite National Park, California, USA, on the number of ﬁres and burn severity (measured from Landsat data for 1984–2010) and on canopy cover at two heights ({\textgreater}2 m and 2–8 m) and dominant tree height (measured with airborne LiDAR data). We used site water balance (actual evapotranspiration and climatic water deﬁcit) and topography (slope position, slope, and insolation) as environmental predictors. Random forest modeling showed that environmental conditions predicted substantial portions of the variations in ﬁre and forest structure: e.g., 85–93\% of the variation in whether a location did not burn, burned once, or burned twice; 64\% of the variation in the burn severity; and 72\% of the variation in canopy cover {\textgreater}2 m for unburned forests, 64\% for once-burned forests, and 59\% for twice-burned forests. Environmental conditions also predicted a substantial portion of forest structure following one and two ﬁres, even though the post-ﬁre forest structures were substantially different than pre-ﬁre structures. This suggests a feedback mechanism in which local ﬁre regimes and pre-ﬁre forest structures are related to local environments, and their interaction produces post-ﬁre structures also related to local environments. Among environmental predictors, water balance had the greatest explanatory power, followed by slope position, and then by slope and insolation. Managers could use our methods to help select reference areas that match environmental conditions, identify areas at risk for ﬁres that endanger critical habitat or other resources, and identify climate analog areas to help anticipate and plan for climate change.},

	abstract = {A coupled hydrologic and snowpack stable water isotope model assesses controls on isotopic inputs across a mountainous basin. Annually, the most depleted isotope conditions occur in the upper subalpine where snow accumulation is high, and rainfall is low. Snowmelt isotopic evolution over time indicates fractionation processes account for {\textless}25\% snowmelt enrichment. Meltwater isotopic inputs are largely determined by controls on the amount, phase and isotopic mass of precipitation coincident with the ablation period. Effect of vapor loss from the snowpack on d-excess in snowmelt is a balance between energy and snow-availability. It is highest above treeline, and in the grass and aspen-dominated portions of the upper montane where vegetation shading is low. Deep snowpack in conifer forests limit the influence of vapor loss in the subalpine. Wet years reduce the effects of vapor loss on snowmelt across the basin, except in the lower montane where added snowfall bolsters snow-limited conditions.},

In the present paper, prediction will be focused on various grades of cervical preneoplasia and neoplasia. Statistical tools used for prediction should of course possess predictive accuracy, and preferably meet secondary requirements such as speed, ease of use, and interpretability of the resulting predictive model. A new automated procedure based on an extension (called ‘boosting’) of regression and classiÿcation tree (CART) models is described. The resulting tool is a fast ‘o -the-shelf’ procedure for classiÿcation and regression that is competitive in accuracy with more customized approaches, while being fairly automatic to use (little tuning), and highly robust especially when applied to less than clean data. Additional tools are presented for interpreting and visualizing the results of such multiple additive regression tree (MART) models. Copyright ? 2003 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {Snow cover and its melt dominate regional climate and water resources in many of the world's mountainous regions. Snowmelt timing and magnitude in mountains are controlled predominantly by absorption of solar radiation and the distribution of snow water equivalent (SWE), and yet both of these are very poorly known even in the best-instrumented mountain regions of the globe. Here we describe and present results from the Airborne Snow Observatory (ASO), a coupled imaging spectrometer and scanning lidar, combined with distributed snow modeling, developed for the measurement of snow spectral albedo/broadband albedo and snow depth/ SWE. Snow density is simulated over the domain to convert snow depth to SWE. The result presented in this paper is the ﬁrst operational application of remotely sensed snow albedo and depth/SWE to quantify the volume of water stored in the seasonal snow cover. The weekly values of SWE volume provided by the ASO program represent a critical increase in the information available to hydrologic scientists and resource managers in mountain regions.},

Local ecological measurements at sites distributed within 20 ecoclimatic domains across the contiguous United States, Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico will be coordinated with high resolution, regional airborne remote sensing observations. The Airborne Observation Platform (AOP) is an aircraft platform carrying remote sensing instrumentation designed to achieve sub-meter to meter scale ground resolution, bridging scales from organisms and individual stands to satellitebased remote sensing. AOP instrumentation consists of a VIS/SWIR imaging spectrometer, a scanning small-footprint waveform LiDAR for 3-D canopy structure measurements and a high resolution airborne digital camera. AOP data will be openly available to scientists and will provide quantitative information on land use change and changes in ecological structure and chemistry including the presence and effects of invasive species. AOP science objectives, key mission requirements, and development status are presented including an overview of near-term risk-reduction and prototyping activities.},

However, forest disturbances and subsequent recovery are shifting with global changes in climate and land use, altering these dynamics. Changes in environmental drivers, land use, and disturbance regimes are forcing forests toward younger, shorter stands. Rising carbon dioxide, acclimation, adaptation, and migration can influence these impacts. Recent developments in Earth system models support increasingly realistic simulations of vegetation dynamics. In parallel, emerging remote sensing datasets promise qualitatively new and more abundant data on the underlying processes and consequences for vegetation structure.
