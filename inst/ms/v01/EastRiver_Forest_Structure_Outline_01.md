e# East River Forest Structure Paper Outline

# Introduction
## A. Big-picture intro ¶
- State factors regulate terrestrial ecosystem development
	- Topography
	- Parent material
	- Climate
	- Organisms
	- Time
- Forest stand structure and composition are two key emergent properties of ecosystem development can be measured in terms of continuous variables at a given point in time
	- Provides fixed-in-time snapshot of forest ecosystem development
- Quantifying relative importance of state factors in regulating ecosystem structure and function is a fundamental question for ecology and biogeochemistry
	- Indeed, a well established tradition in ecology of using gradient analyses to infer the role of environmental factors in governing state properties of ecosystems (Vitousek and Matson 1991). 
- But, gaps:
	- Studies quantifying relative importance of state factors are few
	- Few quantify interactions of state variables
	- The regional dimension: few studies in subalpine forest domain
	- Few studies using continuous estimates of stand structure, capturing full range of variability including end-members
		- Difficult in high-elevation complex terrain, because end-members on topographic and climate gradients are often inaccessible for field measurement
	- In contrast to species abundance and biomass, more granular measures of forest structure (vertical, horizontal heterogeneity) have not been well quantified relative to state variables 
- So, while general relationships between topographic, edaphic, lithologic, and climate state variables, on the one hand, and mature forest structure, on the other, are acknowledged, structural variability across landscape positions has rarely been quantified. 
- Several studies of spatial variability of stand density, size distribution, and species distribution in montane and subalpine forests have produced inconsistent results (e.g. Underwood et al. 2010, Lyderson and North 2012 [TODO: other citations]). 
- This suggests that at least some of the inferences made about these relationships reflect an insufficient reckoning of how state factors interact to affect the hydrologic and energetic conditions in which plants grow (Lookingbill and Urban 2004). 
- Until recently, a major limitation in assessing these relationships has been the lack of spatially continuous data for characterizing forest structure. This limitation may now be partially overcome with active remote sensing technologies like light detection and ranging (LiDAR) ([TODO: CITATION]).
- [TODO] What is the importance of quantifying these relationships?	
	- 
- Objective: identify relationships between state-factor gradients and structure and composition in mixed conifer forests spanning montane and subalpine zones

## B. Variability in forest structure and composition
### 1. Structure ~ topography
- Topographic properties such as elevation, slope, hillslope position, curvature, and aspect substantially influence local microclimate and soil moisture variability (Dobrowski 2011). 
	- As a result, they directly and indirectly constrain trees’ growing environments, influencing demographic rates and exposure to disturbance, and ultimately shaping stand structure, composition, and function (Lyderson and North 2012, Kane et al. 2015). 
	- Even in low-diversity forests, physiognomy can vary dramatically with small changes in position. 
	- This variability is often especially pronounced in mountainous terrain, owing to the potential for large changes in elevation, slope, and aspect over small horizontal distances (Dobrowski 2011).
- In complex terrain, pronounced gradients across space in insolation, precipitation input, and subsurface distribution of water influence plant demographic processes
	- Productivity
	- Biomass accumulation
	- Plant recruitment
	- Mortality
	- Nutrient and gas fluxes
- Topography can also influence disturbance frequency and magnitude, drought and temperature stress, wind exposure >> in turn influencing biotic structure and composition
- General trends assumed (McNab 1989, McNab 1993), *but quantitative reporting limited in the literature* [TODO: verify]
- Generalities:
	- topographic factors are important determinants of forest structure and composition, and that elevation, aspect, and hillslope position matter most. (However, see Kane et al. 2015, where topography explained little of the variance in forest structure in a domain with a frequent fire return interval). 
	- Stem diameter, basal area, growth rates decrease from cove to ridge and from polar to equatorial exposures (Tajchman et al. 1997, Tajchman et al. 1998, Bolstad et al. 1998)
		- "Authors have speculated that lower growth is due to drier soils from cove to ridges and higher vapor pressure deficit or drier soils from northeast to southwest exposures" (Bolstad 2018)
	- Same factors decline with elevation
	- Height growth correlated with a range of topographic properties, including aspect, terrain slope, slope length and position, and curvature (McNab 1989, 1993)

- Problematizing the generalities: 
	- While it is often thought that upper slopes and ridges support stands of lower density and size than convergent sites, this pattern appears to vary across watersheds and landscapes (Kelsey et al. 2018).
	- Lyderson and North (2012) reported contrary findings in a Sierra Nevada mixed conifer forest, where upper slopes had both the highest quadratic mean diameter (QMD) and the tallest trees. 
	- Kane et al. 2015, where topography explained little of the variance in forest structure in a domain with a frequent fire return interval


### 2. Composition ~ topography
- Topography also in part controls species mix (Rowe and Sheard 1981; Barnes et al. 1982; Bailey 1988)
	- "Often affinities for specific landscape positions thought to be attributable to functional trait assemblages (strategies), suggesting adaptation to radiative (Monin et al. 2007, White and Millet 2008) and moisture gradients (Whittaker 1956, Bahari et al. 1986, Day and Monk 1988, Elliott 1999, Denslow et al. 2010, Hawthorne and Miniat 2018)"
- In subalpine forests of the southern Rocky Mountains (SRM), clear topography-driven moisture controls on species occurrence
	- Hadley (1994) reported that ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) dominated xeric sites in the Colorado Front Range, including low-elevation south-facing slopes and steep north-facing slopes. 
	- Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) dominated mesic sites, including north-facing toe-slopes and high-elevation south-facing slopes. 
	- Lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) also occurs on dry upper slopes in the lower range of the subalpine zone (2700–3000 m a.s.l.) (Veblen 1986). 
	- Engelmann spruce (Picea engelmannii) and subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa) tend to co-occur throughout the subalpine zone. 
		- At middle and high elevations up to treeline, the longer-lived spruce is often the canopy dominant (~70 percent of canopy basal area), while fir may occupy up to the same proportion of the understory (Alexander et al. 1984). 
		- Near treeline, pure spruce stands are common, while fir often dominate the canopy in the lower end of the subalpine zone, particularly in xeric topographic positions (Alexander 1987). 

### 3. Structure ~ soil
- Soil properties also matter for structural development
	- Parent material in the top 10 cm of soil explaineda greater share of variation in the abundance of trees across global bioms than any other single factor, including climate and topography (Delgado-Baquerizo et al. 2020)
	- Also a significant expaliner of ecosystem productivity
- [TODO: more on soils from conifer forests in montane, subalpine zones]

### 4. Composition ~ soil 
- [TODO: more on soils from conifer forests in montane, subalpine zones]

### 5. Structure and composition ~ climate
- In forest ecosystems, gradient analysis has consistently identified temperature and water balance as the strongest abiotic factors explaining vegetation species distributions and emergent properties such as canopy structure and carbon density (Veblen 1986, Urban et al. 2000, Hessberg et al. 2007, Holden and Jolly 2011). 
	- Factors strongly controlled by regional and local climate conditions, mediated by topography and soil properties
- Lapse rate assumed to have the strongest control
	- Conifer height tends to decline with temperature and with precipitation (Swensen and Weiser, Hulshof et al. 2015)
- Temperature and precipitation extremely heterogeneous in mountain domains with high topographic relief
	- Site's radiation environment not only regulated by topography via exposure angle, shading by adjacent landforms, but also the origin and distribution of precipitation
	- Orogenic precipitation decouples local precipitation regime from regional patterns ([TODO: citation])
	- Variability in wind exposure leads to snow redistirbution, leads to drifting and patterns of accumulation that may differ from patterns of snowfall ([TODO: citation, see ASO, Deems et al])
- [TODO: more on structural, compositional relationships with climate]

## C. Weaknesses of prior studies
- Many gradient studies have used elevation and convergence as proxies for temperature and soil moisture (Stephenson 1998)
	- Others have developed more complex metrics that combine factors such as elevation, hillslope position, aspect, and slope into climate-proxy indices (Lyderson and North 2012). 
	- A smaller body of work has examined forest structure–topography relationships using suites of quasi-independent measures of topography (see, for example, Hadley 1994, Urban et al. 2000, Underwood et al. 2010, Kane et al. 2015). 
	- Urban and colleagues (2000) used elevation, slope aspect, topographic convergence, and soil depth to model a “physical template” describing the light, temperature, and soil moisture regime of a Sierra Nevada domain, and then examined the sensitivity of modeled forest stand basal area, fuel loading, and canopy depth to the topographic inputs. 
	- Underwood and colleagues (2010) used elevation, slope, aspect, solar radiation, and topographic wetness to divide a Sierra Nevada domain into “landscape management units” representing nine clusters of topographic variability, and examined variation in stem and species density across those units. Their effort relied on data collected in situ from 164 transects. 
	- Ng et al. (2020), similarly, used forest plot data to examine variation in canopy spatial patterns across three hillslope positions (valley, ridge, mid-slope). 
	- [TODO: what exactly is the argument here? Basically, aside from the claim about plot/transect approaches, that these proxy measures may not be enough, or don't fully proxy temperature and soil moisture, or that T/SM proxies aren't enough, don't explain enough of the variance, or insufficiently capture interactions]
- First, while plot- and transect-based data can provide reliable estimates of aboveground forest structure and composition when scaled up to a stand, these data are by nature limited in spatial extent and do not represent the full range of state-factor variability that may constrain the distribution of vegetation across a landscape (Hurtt et al. 2004, Antonarakis et al. 2011, Lyderson and North 2012, Antonarakis et al. 2014). 
- Even within mature, close-canopied forests, characteristics such as stand density, age-class distribution, allometry, species composition, and species dominance can have wide variance and efforts to scale these properties up to a watershed from plot observations alone can yield substantial error terms. 
- Therefore, prior work may have failed to capture important dimensions of co-variability. Kane et al. (2015) and Bolstad et al. (2018) are the only studies we have identified that relate quasi-independent measures of topography to spatially continuous measures of forest structure, although more results have been reported from tropical forests (e.g. Chadwick and Asner 2015, Jucker et al. 2018). 
- A further concern is that the statistical modeling strategies used in prior studies are unable to quantify potential interactions among topographic variables. 
	- Factors such as elevation, hillslope, and curvature work together to define a site’s edaphic, radiative, and moisture environments
	- Also, feedbacks between soil development and moisture conditions 
	- Failing to account for these interactions may amount to a significant oversight. 
-**In part because of these limitations, ecology still lacks a complete accounting of how forest physiognomy co-varies with state factors.**

## D. LiDAR to the rescue
1. LiDAR integrated with field sampling and hyperspectral remote sensing holds promise for overcoming some of these limitations
2. Difficulty of getting subcanopy structure with discrete-point LiDAR
3. One way to mitigate: continuous estimates of properties
	- Limitations
4. Tree-centric approach is redeemable
	- Using full waveform
	- Using recent segmentation algorithms
[TODO: add flesh and citations]

## E. Importance of this work
- Quantifying the drivers of fine-scale heterogeneity in the structure, composition, and function of montane and subalpine forests is important for several reasons. 
	- First, understanding the factors that shape landscape vegetation patterns remains a foundational question in ecology and conservation (Waring and Running 1998, Turner and Gardner 2015). 
	- Second, as in most systems that face the imminent prospect of novel drought and disturbance regimes, there is a need for reference data against which scientists and managers can observe change (Millar et al. 2007).
	- Third, understanding the drivers of heterogeneity is essential for forecasting how mountain forests will respond to regional environmental change, and for devising conservation and management strategies that promote forest resilience. 
	- Fourth, there is a need for both data and inferential analyses that can be used to initialize and benchmark terrestrial ecosystem models used to predict vegetation and flux responses to perturbations (Antonarakis et al. 2011, Antonarakis et al. 2014)

## F. $$ paragraph
- While previous studies have identified general state-factor responses in forest structure and composition, to our knowledge:
	- no study accounts for topo/litho/edapho/climate influences on multiple stand structural and compositional properties all together
	- few directly address microclimatic heterogeneity in high-elevation complex terrain
	- none account for state-variable interactions
	- none does the above on a spatially continuous basis, incorporating end-members on the major radiative and moisture gradients along which forest stands grow
- Our primary objective in this study was to:
	- Quantify relationships between forest structure/composition and environmental attributes that account for the main factors driving stand structural development in subalpine forests broadly representative of low-diversity forests across the Southern Rocky Mountains
		- Proxies for gradients in temperature, radiation, soil moisture 
- We integrated a full-waveform LiDAR dataset acquired over Colorado’s East River watershed with a species classification map derived from imaging spectrometry and field inventory measurements of 7000+ trees to quantify the spatial variability of forest canopy structure through the vertical profile, as well as stand structure and composition. We then used inferential modeling techniques to evaluate the topographic and edaphic regulation of forest stand structure and composition, as estimated at a single point and time.
- We addressed the following questions: 
	1.	To what extent are tree stem height and diameter distributions influenced by the elevation, slope, hillslope position, solar radiation, aspect, and topographic wetness of a site?
	2.	To what extent are total number density, basal area, and species composition controlled by the same topographic factors?
	3.	How do the specified topographic factors interact to mediate these relationships?
- Hypotheses:
	1. the interaction between elevation and topographic wetness is a stronger explainer of total stem density and basal area than any single topographic variable, and that both density and basal area will vary inversely with the two-way interactions. 
	2. We expected a clear division between pine and spruce-fir distributions, explained by the interactions between elevation, aspect, and hillslope. In general, we expected pine to dominate lower-elevation and south-facing slopes and spruce-fir to dominate north-facing slopes and higher elevation positions. However, we anticipated that the interaction between elevation and hillslope position would complicate this general trend somewhat, because of cool-air pooling that allows lower minimum temperatures and lower evaporative demand to persist in valley bottoms, even at low elevations where pine would otherwise be expected (Dobrowksi 2011).
	3. Spruce and fir total stem density to diverge, with spruce density increasing with elevation and fir density reaching a peak at mid-elevations. 

# Data and methods
## A. Study area
- The domain for this project comprises subalpine conifer and aspen forest stands in Colorado’s East River watershed (38°55’ N, 106°56’ W; Fig. 1). The East River is a headwater tributary of the Colorado River, the principal freshwater source for one in 10 people in the U.S. (U.S. Department of the Interior Bureau of Reclamation 2012). The ~750 km2 catchment comprises six major drainages with perennial snowmelt-fed streams. It also has significant topographic heterogeneity: 1420 m of elevational relief, multiple peaks extending above treeline, and pronounced gradients in slope, aspect, insolation, and hillslope position. Mean annual temperature measured at a SNOTEL site (736-Schofield) situated at 3261 m in the watershed is 1.8 º C, with maximum and minimum of 8.3 º C and –28.4 º C respectively. Mean annual precipitation is ~1200 mm y–1; approximately 70 percent falls as snow and 30 percent falls as rain. Maximum air temperatures are depressed by wind at high elevations and minimum air temperatures by cold air downwelling at low elevations. Precipitation is also strongly influenced by elevation, with snow accumulation generally increasing upgradient. 
- The system is driven by seasonal temperature and precipitation regimes that impose important controls on vegetation phenology. Winter snows arrive as early as September, and storms may persist into early June at the highest elevations. Snowmelt typically begins in April and continues through June, concurrently with leaf-out and growth onset. A seasonal drydown occurs in late June and July, characterized by sparse rainfall and soil desiccation as evaporative demand rises with summer temperatures (Harte et al. 1995). In most years, this seasonal moisture deficit is partially mitigated by a July–August monsoon. The driest phase occurs over August–September and can drive severe soil moisture deficits in years when the monsoon fails, as it did in 2018. In addition to these broad patterns, the domain’s stark relief and topographic complexity coordinate to produce highly variable local climatic conditions.
- The domain spans lower montane to alpine ecosystems (2700 m to 3500 m). The dominant tree species are P. engelmannii, A. lasiocarpa, P. contorta, and Populus tremuloides, with occasional P. menziesii at mid-elevations.

## B. Data summary
- Primary data included:
	- Field demography data from 17 permanent mixed-conifer inventory plots, each 0.16 ha in area
	- June 2018 leaf-on NEON AOP full waveform LiDAR acquisition
	- Species-level classification map developed form a simultaneous NEON hyperspectral acquisition (Falco et al. 2022)
	- Digital elevation model (DEM) interpolated from NEON LiDAR ground return points

## C. Data collection and processing
1. Field inventory
	- Between 2018 and 2022, we established 25 long-term forest monitoring plots in the watershed. The sites were stratified across six topographic gradients. Approximately 68 sites were preselected through geospatial analysis of topographic variables derived from the USGS 1/3-arc second digital elevation model (DEM) (citation TK). The gradients are described in Table 1. The distribution of plots along those gradients and correlation statistics for topographic variable pairs appear in Appendix A.
	- Square 40x40 m plots were installed by staking one corner and running a metric tape in a straight line to a point 40 m away to form one edge of the plot. The cardinal orientation and slope angle between points were measured with a digital compass and laser hypsometer, respectively, and the approximate location of the next corner was sighted at an angle of 90º and distance of 40 m from the first. A second tape was run to the approximate corner, and adjusted to achieve the exact distance and angle. This process was repeated for the four edges. The cardinal orientation and slope angle between corners were then remeasured and the distance between corners was adjusted using trigonometric corrections, to approximate a projected flat-surface area of 1600 m. 
	- We then conducted a field inventory of [6700] trees in 17 plots that lay within the acquisition footprint of a 2018 NEON Airborne Observation Platform (AOP) campaign. All trees of any species with a diameter at breast height (DBH, measured at 1.3 m) >1.0 cm were tagged with an aluminum tag affixed with a nail if the specimen was >10cm DBH and with an expanding collar if the specimen was <10cm DBH. Measurements taken from each tree are summarized in Table 2. Measurements were taken from more than 6000 conifers for training and validating models developed in the remote sensing analysis.

2. Waveform LiDAR processing
	- Between June 12 and 26, 2018, the National Ecological Observatory Network's Airborne Observation Platform (NEON AOP; Kampe et al. 2009) conducted a survey of approximately 330 km2 of the watershed, including 10 of our forest inventory plots (Chadwick et al. 2020, Fig. 1). The AOP collected high-fidelity VSWIR spectrometry at 1 m resolution using an AVRIS-NG visible and infrared imaging spectrometer. The platform also collected LiDAR using an Optech Gemini discrete LiDAR sensor and waveform digitizer. The LiDAR sensor’s pulse repetition frequency varied between 33 and 100 kHz. The spectrometer and LiDAR platforms were co-aligned with an onboard GPS/IMU system. Validation was conducted using in situ data at 437 sites representing a range of vegetative and built land cover types. 
	- Discrete-return point density in the post-processed dataset ranged between 1 and 9 returns m-2, which was insufficient for characterizing subcanopy structure. I have therefore elected to use the full waveforms, which have a nominal density between 1 and 4 pulses m-2. The full-waveform pulses contain considerably more information than discrete points and can be exploited to develop more complete characterizations of stand and canopy structure. 

3. Tree segmentation and cross-validation
	- Generated both an individual tree crown (ITC) map of conifer and aspen forest and continuous gridded estimates of forest structure (as in Dalponte and Coombes 2016). The former comprise a map of individual tree crowns in mixed-conifer forest stands describing species, height, crown area, and stem diameter of each crown, along with estimates of detection error. The latter comprises a continuous map of forest structure metrics at 1m, 40m, 100m, and 1km grid scales. 
	- For returns intersecting each field plot boundary, I used a spectral deconvolution procedure to isolate the target-response signal from its interactions with the outgoing pulse, atmospheric scattering, and sensor-system noise (Zhou et al. 2017). I then applied an adaptive Gaussian decomposition, which fits one or more Gaussian models to the waveform components based on Equation 1: 
	$$f(x,θ) = \Sigma_(i=1)^n A_i exp(〖(x-μ_i)〗^λ/(2σ_i^2 ))$$			(1)

	- $A_i$ is the amplitude of waveform component $i$, $μ$ is the bin location of $i$ (measured as a point in time, ns), $σ$ is the standard deviation of $i$, and $λ$ is a rate parameter that minimizes the model residual over a specified number of iterations. I used the implementation of this algorithm in the waveformlidar package in the R statistical environment (Zhou et al. 2018). The algorithm first identifies potential peaks in the waveform, then iteratively fits models to the data centered on each peak, selecting the model that minimizes root mean square error between the raw waveform and the model and excluding models that produce physically meaningless parameters (such as a negative A). Where multiple peaks exist, the algorithm fits a separate model to each and expresses the final fit as the sum of n Gaussian functions.

	- After processing the waveforms, I geolocated the Gaussian peaks and extracted characteristic metrics from the fitted waveforms. These included the peaks’ location in three-dimensional space, their amplitude and width, front slope, and time to median intensity. I then used the R package lidR to discretize this information, creating an array of information-enriched points overlying the boundaries of each forest plot. I normalized the points to the earth’s surface by kriging the ground returns and subtracting z values from the interpolated surface (Fig. 3).
	- As a next step, the field data from each of our mixed-conifer plots and equivalent data from a subset of aspen plots inventoried by Ben Blonder’s research group, will be applied to parameterize and validate the ITC model through fitting linear and Gaussian process models. The field data will be split into training (80%) and validation (20%) sets, with the validation set reserved for final error estimation and the training set iteratively resampled using k-fold cross-validation. The ITC procedure will be iteratively re-parameterized by adjusting window size, maximum allowed crown diameter, and vertical and horizontal search coefficients until cross-validation produces suitable crown detection rate scores across size classes.
	- Next, the ITC objects will be fused with a 1 m resolution forest species classification dataset, developed through a support vector machine classifier on 2018 NEON AOP hyperspectral imagery (Falco 2020). Each object will be assigned to a given tree species according to the majority rule, i.e., if 50% or more of the pixels intersecting the object are classified to that species (Dalponte et al. 2019). For trees where <50% of pixels belong to a single species, the object will be labeled “unknown.”
	- To estimate the stem diameters of each delineated object, I will use an ensemble regression approach trained on ITC height and crown area and field-measured diameters assigned to objects in plots, using 10-fold cross-validation. The classification will again be cross-validated with geolocation, height, diameter, and species records from field data. This cross-validation and reparameterization process is required because allometric relationships between height, tree diameter, and crown area can vary widely with elevation, exposure, and other factors. 
	- I will use the optimized parameters to run the ITC procedure on all of the waveforms, and validate on the 20% of data reserved in the initial training-validation split. From the full ITC model, I plan compute continuous area-based structural and compositional metrics, including total number density, species density, basal area, and canopy cover, and max and mean diameter will by summarizing object-level predictions at specified grid scales across the watershed. The metrics will include total tree number density, size class density, basal area, canopy cover, and maximum and mean diameter. They will also include species-explicit estimates including species composition (proportion of pixel area occupied by each species), species density (number of individuals of each species per pixel), and species dominance (majority species per pixel). 

4. Inferential modeling
	- I will use these structure and composition data layers along with topographic features derived from a digital elevation model, all at 100m resolution, to evaluate the effects of topographic position on species composition and forest structure. The proposed explanatory and response variables are summarized in Table 3.

# Results

# Discussion

## Relationships with biological processes
- [TODO: FIND ANALOGUE] "Yellow-poplar is a mesophytic species that responds in height growth mainly to physical properties that affect the capacity of the soil to supply moisture and somewhat to soil chemical properties (McNab 1989: Beck and Della-Bianca 1981)"
	- height correlated with depth of organic matter?
	- height correlated with leaf litter?
	- wind-caused redeposition of forest litter and nutrient-loaded dust?
- How are soil organic matter, soil depth correlated with concavity, convexity?
- [TODO: FIND ANALOGUE] "differential rates of litter accumulation and decomposition, and its subsequent effects on soil physical properties, may be a contributing cause of the differences in growth of yellow-poplar on microsites with various land surface shapes" (McNab 1989)
- "minor landforms may be a more important source of areal site variation within stands... than previously recognized" (McNab 1989)

## Limitations
- We don't account for:
	- Disturbance
	- Individual life histories
	- Anthropogenic development and logging legacy
	- Non-woody vegetation
	- Subsurface ecology--micorrhizal networks, microbiome, which exert control on tree productivity and composition through association

Panel A shows the raw (dashed black) waveform function and the resulting deconvolved (dark blue) and decomposed (light blue) time series, all over a trimmed 100 ns support. Waveform peaks and a random sample of values along peak slopes were selected to generate a point cloud with a mean density of 24 points m2-1 across the acquisition area. An example of this high-density point cloud at one inventory plot (SG-SWR1) with a 10 m buffer is shown in panel B.

SWE has an overall flattening effect on the elevation-density curve. Where SWE is high and elevation is high, density is also at a maximum. Where SWE is high but elevation is low, this has a substantial dampening effect on all three structural parameters.

Figure 8. Elevation accounted for differences in the shape of allometric curves describing the relationship between tree DBH and height. Curves are fitted to census data according to the function height = A(DBHb) (A). The coefficient A in the equation declines with elevation, indicating that, as elevation increases, height growth diminishes per unit growth in girth (B).
