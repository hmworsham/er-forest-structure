abstract: A consensus suggests that abiotic constraints explain much of the variability in forest structure from scales ranging from hillslope to continent. At broad scales, climatic factors such as actual evapotranspiration (AET) and climatic water deficit (CWD) often emerge as the strongest constraints. However, at finer scales, such as that of a watershed or basin, synoptic climate may have less influence than other locally varying topographic and edaphic factors, or such factors may mediate synoptic climate in ways that trees must respond to physiologically. Here we present a novel analysis of abiotic constraints on a complement of conifer stand structural characteristics on a spatially continuous basis at the scale of a watershed. We use full-waveform LiDAR to quantify various aspects of stand structure across their full range of expression in an upper montane--subapline domain in the Rocky Mountains of Colorado. We evaluate covariability of these structural metrics with a suite of climate, topography, soil, geologic variables, incorporating end-members of the abiotic gradients along which forest stands grow. We report the relative importance of abiotic factors and describe the functional behavior of individual covariates, as well as interactions between explanatory factors. Our findings suggest that density is explained primarily by factors connected to snow input and soil water storage. Maximum canopy height, QMD, and BA are also primarily explained by snow and soil moisture factors, with elevation as a mediator and with inverse functional relationships to several explainers compared to density. Height skew, which describes the balance of larger and smaller age classes in a stand, is less well correlated with all factors. Quantifying the drivers of fine-scale heterogeneity in the structure of montane and subalpine forests is an essential preliminary for understanding how these systems will respond to synoptic environmental change, establishing a reference against which these responses can be measured, and for devising conservation and management strategies that promote forest resilience.

# 1. Introduction

Subalpine forests are outsize contributors to regional hydrological budgets, accounting for as much as half of water export from high-elevation watersheds (Rasmussen et al. 2014; Aron et al. 2019). These systems are increasingly exposed to moisture and temperature stresses associated with climate change. Because of their contributions to the net ecosystem exchange of water and carbon between the Earth surface and atmposphere (Keith et al., 2009; Malhi, Doughty and Galbraith 2011), changes in the structure and composition of these forests are expected to have multiplicative effects on the timing and quantity of water released into the major water basins of the Western U.S. (Milly and Dunne 2011; Foster et al. 2020). While the environmental factors that shape forest structure have been a foundational concern in ecology and conservation (Waring and Running 1998, Turner and Gardner 2015), they have largely been evaluated at continental to global scales and have overlooked potentially important aspects of local variability (@stephenson_climatic_1990). Understanding the fine-scale drivers of structural and compositional variability is essential for benchmarking and forecasting how mountain forests respond to novel environmental pressures, and for devising conservation and management strategies that promote forest resilience. 

Forest structure and composition emerge from complex interactions between a variable abiotic environment and the trait-driven mechanisms by which biotic agents influence or respond to this environment @prentice_concepts_1986; @prentice_pattern_1990; @mcdowell_pervasive_2020. A large corpus of work has described these interactions (e.g. @shreve_vegetation_1915 and @whittaker_consideration_1953; @delcourt_dynamic_1982; @stephenson_climatic_1990; @urban_forest_2000; @swensen_ecological_2007; Moles et al. 2009; @swensen_plant_2010; Zhang et al. 2016; @fricker_more_2019). At broad (i.e. continental or global) scales, climate is often the dominant feature in these interactions and is therefore thought to be the primary driver of species distributions and structural diversity (@whittaker_consideration_1953; @urban_landscape_1987; @stephenson_climatic_1990). 

Gradient analyses have often identified temperature and moisture (usually indexed with precipitation) as the strongest climatic constraints on species distributions and physiognomy (see @stephenson_climatic_1990's review). However, several limitations hamper interpretation of these effects. First, temperature and precipitation tend to covary closely along elevational and latitudinal gradients and so cannot be easily disentangled (@urban_2000). Second, this same interdependence may obscure underlying vegetation-environment dynamics: e.g. temperature partially drives atmospheric demand and influences stomatal regulation, contributing both positive and negative feedbacks to plant-available moisture (Peters et al. 2018). And third, the asynchrony of precipitation input and atmospheric demand in many domains can lead to seasonal bias in estimates of plant-available water and energy over time (@stephenson_climatic_1990; @stephenson_actual_1998; @urban_landscape_1987). Adding to the muddle, recent work has challenged the primacy of climate altogether: at least one study has found that edaphic properties, namely parent material in the upper 10 cm soil layer, explain a greater share of variation in the abundance of trees across global biomes than climate factors (@delgado-baquerizo_influence_2020), though this may be partially explained by connections between soil composition and moisture capacity.

As difficult as it has proven at broad scales to isolate specific abiotic drivers of emergent forest properties and to quantify their relative influence, the task is perhaps even more difficult at finer scales, such as those of the watershed or hillslope, where other locally varying factors modulate or mask synoptic climate signals. For instance, topographic properties such as elevation and aspect substantially influence local radiation and soil moisture and thereby modulate regional climate forcings (@dobrowski_climatic_2011; Adams et al. 2014; Barnard et al. 2017). 

Even in low-diversity forests, physiognomy can vary dramatically with small changes in position. This variability is often especially pronounced in mountainous domains because of the potential for large changes in topographic position over small horizontal distances (@dobrowski_climatic_2011). In temperate mountain forests, structural characteristics such as stem diameter, basal area, and maximum tree height are generally thought to decline with increasing elevation, with temperature as the key limiting control (Whittaker 1956; Day and Monk 1988). The same properties also decline from valley to ridge positions--perhaps as a result of decreasing soil moisture along the convergence gradient--and from northeast-to-southwest exposures in the Northern Hemisphere--perhaps due to increasing vapor pressure deficit along the aspect gradient (@mcnab_terrain_1989; @mcnab_topographic_1993; @bolstad_forests_2018). Topography also appears to influence species mix (Rowe and Sheard 1981; Barnes et al. 1982; Bailey 1988). Species affinities for certain topographic positions may be attributable to functional strategies developed in response to variability in radiative (Monin et al. 2007; White and Millet 2008) and hydrologic (Whittaker 1956, Day and Monk 1988; Hawthorne and Miniaat 2018) regimes. 

While these general trends are often assumed, the actual environment-vegetation complex that appears on a landscape can be considerably more difficult to predict. A site's radiation regime, for instance, may be further modified by shading from adjacent landforms, while its precipitation regime may be modified by local orographic lift or rain shadowing. Steep slopes can increase the risk of biomechanical damage (King et al. 2009), while wind exposure may mechanically limit tree height (Larjavaara 2010) and produce heterogeneous patterns of snow redistribution and ablation (Hiemstra et al. 2002). Further, soil properties (parent material, texture, depth, e.g.) directly constrain plant-available water and nutrients. Any of these factors, or their system of interactions, poses constraints to which trees must respond.

It is worth noting that the preponderance of data supporting the assumed trends comes from Eastern North American deciduous forests and the tropics, and very little from forests of Western ranges, where one might expect even more pronounced topoclimatic variability. The few studies that have evaluated a complement of abiotic controls on forest structure and composition in Western mountain domains challenge some of these assumptions. @fricker_more_2019 found that climatic water deficit (CWD) and mean annual precipitation (MAP) explained the majority of variance in the distribution of maximum tree heights along an elevational gradient in the Sierra Nevada. They also reported that, although taller trees occurred (as expected) in convergent, low-radiation positions, the elevational control on height was strongly non-linear, with bimodal maxima near the lower and upper elevational limits of the domain. This may suggest an "ameliorative" effect of radiation exposure on the elevational lapse rate. @greenberg_limitations_2009 found a unimodal distribution of stem densities in a Sierra Nevada basin, with the highest densities occurring around 1900 m a.s.l., but with a clear divergence in density between high radiation, low moisture (i.e. water-limited) and low radiation, high moisture (i.e., energy-limited) positions. @lydersen_topographic_2012 found the tallest and largest-diameter trees on upper slopes and at elevations above 1690 m in mixed conifer forests across the Sierra Nevada. @kane_water_2015 found that topography explained little variance in forest structure in a Sierra Nevada domain with a frequent fire return interval. 

These observed deviations may indicate that fundamentally different constraints act on forest structure in the West, where actual evapotranspiration (AET) is much lower than in Eastern forests and where AET increases and moisture deficit declines with increasing elevation. It is thought that these dynamics work together to impose water limitations on lower-elevation forests and energy limitations on high-elevation forests (Kane et al. 2015), but more recent work on water-energy limitation dynamics suggest that they are far more dynamically controlled than by elevation alone: slope and aspect, for instance, drive feedbacks to soil moisture, vegetation cover, and soil formation/erosion that create assymetries in expected water- and energy-limitation gradients (Pelletier et al. 2018; Wainwright et al. 2022).

One major challenge in confronting these uncertainties has been the difficulty of acquiring representative measurements of forest structure and their environmental covariates. Almost all prior work in this area has relied on plot or transect observations, which likely do not represent the full ranges of either structural/compositional or abiotic gradients, particularly in complex, inaccessible terrain (@hurtt_beyond_2004; @antonarakis_using_2011, @lydersen_topographic_2012, @antonarakis_imaging_2014). Even within mature, close-canopied forests, characteristics such as stand density, age-class distribution, allometry, species composition, and species dominance can have wide variance. Efforts to scale up these properties to a watershed from plot observations (or plot-benchmarked models) alone can yield substantial error terms.

Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) may help to overcome some of these limitations by enabling comprehensive measurements of forest structure on a spatially continuous basis (@mallet_full-waveform_2009). In particular, full-waveform LiDAR datasets from aerial and satellite platforms, along with new open-source libraries for cleaning and processing the data, have the potential to provide spatially rich information about forest stand characteristics (@mallet_full-waveform_2009; @zhou_waveformlidar_2019; @zhou_gold_2017). Like discrete-return points, waveforms can be used to delineate individual canopy trees and to estimate individual-scale characteristics such as stem diameter, stem height, stem volume, and crown volume (@jucker_allometric_2017; @zhou_waveformlidar_2019; @dalponte_system_2011). Waveforms can also be processed to generate continuous estimates of forest structure parameters at the grid scale. Using waveforms appears to yield higher accuracy than discrete returns in both object-oriented and continuous-estimate methods, particularly for characterizing mid-canopy and sub-canopy structure (@anderson_is_2016; @adams_another_2011; Chauve et al. 2009). Calibrating remote sensing estimates against *in situ* stem diameter and height measurements yields further accuracy improvements (@antonarakis_using_2011; @jucker_allometric_2017). 

In addition, hyperspectral remote sensing data have increasingly been used to characterize species abundance and compositional patterns in forests (Plourde et al. 2007; @anderson_integrating_2008; Fricker et al. 2019; Falco et al. in review). The advantage of hyperspectral sensing lies in the specificity with which it records spectral responses, which can be leveraged to generate accurate target classifications. Integrating information on forest structure and species composition can improve the dimensionality and detail of ecosystem representation from remote sensing (@anderson_integrating_2008; Asner 2012; Marrs 2019).

@kane_water_2015, @bolstad_forests_2018, @greenberg_limitations_2009, and @fricker_more_2019 are the only studies we have identified that use LiDAR to evaluate forest structure or composition along abiotic gradients on a spatially continuous basis in temperate North American forests, and we have found none from the Rocky Mountains. Additionally, to our knowledge, no prior study has (a) exploited the high granularity of waveform LiDAR to estimate multiple structural properties through the canopy profile and integrated these estimates with species compositional metrics, and (b) characterized their associations with climate, topography, soil, and lithology on a spatially continuous basis. To address this gap, we evaluated two questions in low-diversity subalpine conifer forests broadly representative of those occurring across the Southern Rocky Mountains: 

1. How accurately can various aspects of forest stand structure be predicted through the canopy profile, and what is the predicted distribution of forest structure parameters across this landscape?
2. Which climate, topographic, and substrate variables exert the strongest influences on conifer forest stand structure and species mix, and to what extent do these features interact?

We used a full-waveform LiDAR dataset acquired over Colorado’s East River watershed to quantify forest canopy structure through the vertical profile. We integrated these metrics with a species classification map derived from imaging spectrometry and assessed the performance of structural and compositional estimates using field inventory measurements of 4355 trees. We then used inferential modeling strategies to quantify the relative influence of individual  and interacting abiotic factors on the spatial variability of forest stand structure and composition.

<!-- Hypotheses: -->
<!-- 	1. the interaction between elevation and topographic wetness is a stronger explainer of total stem density and basal area than any single topographic variable, and that both density and basal area will vary inversely with the two-way interactions.  -->
<!-- 	2. We expected a clear division between pine and spruce-fir distributions, explained by the interactions between elevation, aspect, and hillslope. In general, we expected pine to dominate lower-elevation and south-facing slopes and spruce-fir to dominate north-facing slopes and higher elevation positions. However, we anticipated that the interaction between elevation and hillslope position would complicate this general trend somewhat, because of cool-air pooling that allows lower minimum temperatures and lower evaporative demand to persist in valley bottoms, even at low elevations where pine would otherwise be expected (Dobrowksi 2011). -->
<!-- 	3. Spruce and fir total stem density diverge, with spruce density increasing with elevation and fir density reaching a peak at mid-elevations.  -->

# 2. Methods
## 2.1. Study area
The study domain comprised upper montane-subalpine conifer forest stands in Colorado’s East River watershed (38°55’ N, 106°56’ W; Fig. 1). The East River is a headwater tributary of the Colorado River, the principal freshwater source for one in 10 people in the U.S. (U.S. Department of the Interior Bureau of Reclamation 2012). The 750 km^2^ catchment includes six major drainages discharging to perennial streams. It also has significant topographic heterogeneity: 1420 m of elevational relief, multiple peaks extending above treeline, and pronounced gradients in slope, aspect, insolation, and hillslope position. Mean annual temperature is 1.9 º C, with a mean monthly maximum and minimum of 11.2 º C and –7.1 º C respectively, measured 1980--2023 at the NOAA Crested Butte weather station (CBUC2) at 2700 m near the center of the watershed. Mean annual precipitation is 1200 mm y^–1^, approximately 70 percent arriving as winter snow and 30 percent as rain during the summer monsoon. Maximum air temperatures are depressed at high elevations and minimum air temperatures by cold air downwelling at low elevations. Precipitation is also strongly influenced by elevation, with snow accumulation generally increasing with higher elevation. Besides these broad patterns, the domain’s stark relief and topographic complexity coordinate to produce highly variable local climatic conditions. 

Soils are derived from varied, primarily sedimentary material intruded by igneous laccoliths. Heterogeneous soil composition and drainage potential drives substantial variability in plant available water. 

The dominant tree species are *Picea engelmannii*, *Abies lasiocarpa*, *Pinus contorta*, and *Populus tremuloides*, with occasional *Pseudotsuga menziesii* and *Pinus flexilis* at mid-elevations and one known population of *Pinus longaeva* near treeline on one peak. Natural histories of subalpine forests elsewhere in Colorado describe species distribution patterns that largely hold in this domain. *P. engelmannii* and *A. lasiocarpa* tend to co-occur in high densities throughout the subalpine zone (~2700–-3000 m a.s.l.) and only sparsely in the upper montane zone (~1850--2900 m a.s.l.). At middle and high elevations up to treeline, the longer-lived spruce is often the canopy dominant (~70 percent of canopy basal area), while fir may occupy up to the same proportion of the understory (Alexander et al. 1984). Near treeline, pure spruce stands are common, while fir often dominate the canopy in the lower end of the subalpine zone, particularly in xeric topographic positions (Alexander 1987). Douglas fir (*Pseudotsuga menziesii*) tend to dominate mesic sites, including north-facing toe-slopes and high-elevation south-facing slopes. *P. contorta* also occur intermixed with spruce and fir on dry, southerly upper slopes in the lower range of the subalpine zone and abundantly in monospecific, even-aged stands throughout the montane zone, particularly on south-facing slopes and steep slopes of all aspects (Veblen 1986). Near the lower limits of the Engelmann spruce and subalpine fir elevational range, lodgepole pine tends to establish as a pioneer post-disturbance and is later replaced by the former species (Whipple and Dix 1979). 

Management and disturbance influence forest structure and could obscure relationships between forest vital rates, emergent structure/composition, and underlying abiotic constraints. Logging related to the mining industry occurred in some parts of the watershed during the 19th and early 20th centuries, with a limited footprint enduring today. This said, the watershed includes large stands where little to no tree removal occurred, and stands with old trees and uneven age and size structure are well distributed. In addition, all forested areas analyzed sit on Forest Service land, and 22 percent of these in management-restricted wilderness. We suggest that, because of its low timber value, long fire return intervals, and relative lack of recent management, this domain offers a more realistic basis for understanding abiotic drivers of stand structure in a temperate conifer forest than previous efforts.

## 2.2 Full-waveform LiDAR
Between June 12 and 26, 2018, the National Science Foundation National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) Airborne Observation Platform (AOP; @kampe_neon_2010) surveyed approximately 330 km^2^ of the watershed (@goulden_neon_2020; @goulden_post_2020; @chadwick_integrating_2020; Fig. 1). The AOP collected discrete-range and full-waveform LiDAR returns using an Optech Gemini discrete LiDAR sensor and waveform digitizer with a pulse repetition frequency between 33 and 100 kHz. Discrete-return point density in the post-processed dataset ranged between 1 and 9 returns $m^{-2}$, which was insufficient for characterizing subcanopy structure. We therefore elected to process the full waveforms, which had a nominal density between 1 and 4 pulses m^-2^. Exploiting the higher information density of full-waveform pulses allowed us to develop more complete characterizations of stand structure than would have been possible with discrete returns alone.

We followed a standard approach for processing the waveforms into an analyzable structure. First, we used a spectral deconvolution procedure to isolate the target-response signal from its interactions with the LiDAR system's outgoing pulse, atmospheric scattering, and system noise. We used the Gold deconvolution algorithm in the `waveformlidar` package in the R statistical computing environment (@zhou_waveformlidar_2019), but refactored its implementation for parallel computing. The result of the algorithm approximates the true distribution of scattering objects along the outbound light pulse's path. We then applied an adaptive Gaussian decomposition algorithm to fit one or more Gaussian models to the return pulse components based on Equation 1 (Harding 2005): 

$$f(x,\theta) = \sum_{(i=1)}^{n} A_i exp\biggl[-\frac{(x-\mu_i)^\lambda}{(2\sigma_i^2)}\biggr]$$ {#eq:eqn1}

where $A_i$ is the amplitude of waveform component $i$, $\mu$ is the bin location of $i$ (measured as a point in time, ns), $\sigma$ is the standard deviation of $i$, and $\lambda$ is a penalty parameter that minimizes model residual over a specified number of iterations. Fitting was accomplished using the function `nlsLM` in the R package `minpack.lm`. Where multiple peaks were detected, the algorithm fit a separate function to each and expressed the final fit as the sum of $n$ Gaussian functions. 

The deconvolution and decomposition procedures were applied to the full set of waveforms in parallel on 256 cores on the University of California, Berkeley's high-performance computing cluster. In total, we processed approximately 1.4*10^9^ waveform returns. Of these, a negligible fraction (approximately 0.5 percent) either had no detectable peaks or represented backscatter records that could not be fit to a Gaussian function. Where peaks could not be identified, the waveforms were dropped from the set. Where they could not be fit to the Gaussian, the characteristic components (e.g, amplitude, time to median energy) were estimated from the deconvolved returns directly, without curve fitting.

After decomposition, we used the geolocation matrices provided with the NEON data to geolocate the waveforms and then extracted characteristic metrics from the fitted waveforms. These included the peaks’ location in three-dimensional space, their amplitude and width, front slope, and time to median intensity (NEON 2015). We then used the R package `rlas` to discretize this information (Jean-Romain 2022). We normalized the discretized points to the Earth surface by differencing their z-values against a digital elevation model (DEM) derived from the discretized point cloud. We then decimated the high-density returns, preserving all of the identified peaks to obtain a discretized point cloud of 5.72*10^9^ points with a uniform density of 15.3 points m^-2^ across the domain.

## 2.3 Field census

Between 2018 and 2022, we established 25 long-term forest monitoring plots in the East River and nearby drainages. The sites were stratified across six topographic gradients (Table 1). An initial set of 68 sites was preselected via Latin hypercube sampling on six topographic gradients derived from the USGS 1/3-arc second DEM (@usgs_dem_2017). The final 25 sites were selected from among that group after scouting and optimizing the distribution of the set along the topographic gradients (Fig. S1). At each site we installed a 40 m x 40 m plot, using slope corrections to approximate a projected flat-surface area of 1600 m^2^. To minimize edge effects, we located plots at least 100 m from forest edges and major compositional transitions. We aimed to partially mitigate unobserved management and disturbance effects by siting inventory plots in stands where no recent harvest or major disturbance had occurred, based on (a) visual inspection for cut stumps and remnants and (b) stability of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) over the 40-year Landsat record (1980-present).

We used a survey-grade GNSS receiver (Trimble Geo 7X, Trimble, Inc.) to georeference all plot locations *in situ*. To establish absolute georeferencing we made a minimum of six measurements over multiple days at each plot corner and took the arithmetic mean of recorded coordinates, inversely weighted by reported horizontal uncertainty. Positioning data were post-processed in TerraSync (Trimble Inc.) with differential correction using the Continuously Operating Reference Stations (CORS) Network station SE01 (39.40035, -107.212101; NOAA 2020). Estimated planimetric accuracy of plot corner locations was $\pm$ 0.35 m.

Between 2018 and 2022 we conducted a field census of approximately 9000 trees in the 25 plots (Table 2). All trees of any species with a diameter at breast height (DBH, measured at 1.3 m above the ground) $\geq$ 1.0 cm were labeled with an aluminum tag. For each tagged tree, we recorded species and measured diameter at breast height (DBH) using a standard metric forestry diameter tape (for stems $\gt$ 7 cm DBH) or calipers ($\leq$ 7 cm). We measured stem heights with a Nikon LaserPro II laser hypsometer (for stems $\gt$ 5 m in height) or a rigid metric tape measure ($\leq$ 5 m). To maximize precision, hypsometer measurements were repeated on each tree until measurements converged within 0.5 m. Expected vertical accuracy on hypsometer measurements was $\pm$ 1.0 m. 

Stems were then geolocated using either the GNSS receiver or by measuring the direction and distance from a geolocated reference tree with a digital compass and rigid metric tape. For those positioned with the GNSS, the receiver was positioned in contact with the side of each tree stem at 1.3 m. We enforced a maximum estimated horizontal uncertainty threshold of 1.0 m during recording, and we recorded a minimum of 30 positional observations at a rate of 1 observation s^-1^ for each stem. In total, 5899 (89.4 percent) of the stems surveyed were positioned. Those without unique geolocations were less than 5 m in height and were fully suppressed beneath the canopy of another tree, such that it was extremely unlikely for tree crown segmentation to differentiate the suppressed tree from the dominant. For geotagged trees, mean planimetric accuracy was 1.01 m (s.d = 0.70 m).

Seventeen of the 25 plots lay within the overflight footprint of a 2018 NEON AOP acquisition (@goulden_neon_2020; @goulden_post_2020; @chadwick_integrating_2020). We used the observations from this subset for training and validation of models developed in the next phase of analysis. The 17 focal plots contained 5828 observed trees, of which 5416 were living at the time of inventory. 

## 2.4. Tree crowns, species composition, and stand structure

### 2.4.1 Tree crowns
We followed the general approach in Dalponte and Coomes (2016) to generate an individual tree crown (ITC) map and gridded estimates of conifer forest structure and composition. The tree crown map comprised point objects describing the position, height, and stem diameter of all trees $gt$ 1.3 m height in conifer stands. The gridded data comprised continuous maps of forest structure metrics at 100m grid scale. To generate these products, we integrated the discretized LiDAR and inventory data to optimize and validate an individual tree detection (ITD) model at the field plots, which we then applied in the watershed's remaining forested area. As we detail below, this approach (1) iterated through many permutations of possible parameters for seven ITD algorithms; (2) computed performance metrics at each iteration; and (3) selected the best performing algorithm and parameter set to apply to out-of-sample data. 

First, we extracted the discretized LiDAR data within a 5 m buffer around the boundaries of each field plot. We then attempted to detect tree crown objects from the discretized data using algorithm $A_i$ and parameter set $\lambda_{j,k:l}$, where $\lambda_j$ is one of a set of parameters taking user-specified values required for the algorithm to proceed, and $k:l$ is a vector of values on that parameter (Table S1). The 5 m buffer ensured that points associated with trees along plot boundaries were correctly included in the operation; however, any trees identified in the buffer zone outside of the plots were removed after each detection attempt. We then applied the automated matching procedure described in @eysn_benchmark_2015 and @pang_nystrom-based_2021 to link detection results to reference observations from field inventory. In this way, we were able to evaluate the performance of each algorithm-parameter combination and compare models against each other. We opted for an automated matching approach because (1) the computational scale of our method (up to 2800 delineation attempts per algorithm per site) made manual interpretation infeasible, and (2) doing so enabled us to enforce clear, objective rules for reproducibility. In early testing, we also evaluated bipartite matching strategies seeking to minimize the Euclidean and Mahalanobis distances between detected and reference trees (@hansen_optimal_2006). We ultimately selected the @eysn_benchmark_2015 method based on superior inter-tree and inter-site matching performance. 

The matching process began by selecting the tallest detected tree ("target") and searching for candidates among reference trees satisfying Euclidean height (∆Z) and horizontal distance (∆XY) criteria specified in Table 3. The reference candidate with the least ∆XY was chosen as a tentative match to the target. The candidates were then queried a second time. If a candidate with greater ∆XY proved closer in height to the target, and its ∆XY was at most 2.5 m more than ∆XY of the tentative match, it was selected as the match. However, since an optimal match depends not only on the neighborhood of reference trees, but also on other nearby *detected* trees, the target was then compared against other detected neighbors. If another detected tree was closer in horizontal and vertical distance to the matched reference, the pairing was discarded. This process was repeated on all remaining detected trees in descending order of height, until all reference trees had been evaluated. Matches were then removed from the set, and the process was repeated until no further matches could be found under the search criteria. 
For each run of $\lambda_{i,j:k}$ on $A_i$ we tallied the extracted trees, true positives (TP, or successful matches) false positives (FP, or commission errors), and false negatives (FN, or omission errors). We used these values to compute the performance statistics in Table 4. The root mean squares (RMS) of all performance statistics were calculated across the 17 plots as unbiased estimators of the performance of each $A_i$ and parameter set $\lambda_{i,j:k}$.

We then selected the algorithm and parameter permutation that had yielded the maximum root mean square *F* score across all $\lambda_{i,j:k}$. *F* is a proportion representing the harmonic mean of precision (the proportion of all tree detections that were correctly matched) and recall (the proportion of all possible matches that were correctly matched). Perfect detection and match rates would yield an *F* score of 1.0, while failure would yield 0.0. It was selected as the optimization statistic over overall accuracy for its balanced sensitivity to both over- and under-detection. 

Of the eight algorithms tested, LayerStacking (@ayrey_layer_2017) yielded the highest *F* score across training and testing sets (Table 4, Table S2). The algorithm proceeds by first dividing the point cloud into stacked horizontal layers at 1-m intervals, starting at $\lambda_1$ m above ground (Table 5). A series of clustering procedures is then applied to each layer. In the lowest three layers ($\lambda_{1}+1 : \lambda_{1}+3$ m a.g.), points are clustered through Density-Based Scanning (Ester et al. 1996); points within these initial clusters are removed as non-tree low vegetation, while those lying outside clusters are retained as sparse returns from small tree boles. Next, a canopy height model (CHM) of resolution $\lambda_2$ is computed from the point cloud. Tree tops are identified from the CHM using a local maximum filter (LMF) with a window of radius $\lambda_3$. Then, points in each layer undergo *k*-means clustering, using the local maxima as seeds, and a polygonal buffer of radius $\lambda_4$ is placed around each resulting cluster. The polygons from each layer are then flattened and rasterized to create an intermediate "overlap map." This abstraction quantifies the density of clusters, such that areas of high-density polygonal overlap represent individual trees. In conifer forests, this delineation can be improved with an additional parameter, $\lambda_5$, which enforces higher weighting for clusters near the canopy top, because these tend to be closer to a conifer's center. A second LMF is applied to the overlap map, using a window of radius $\lambda_6$, and local maxima are taken to be tree centers. Additional smoothing of the local maxima, and filtering and merging of clusters, yields a set of points representing tree tops with embedded height and position information.

For the remainder of the LiDAR-surveyed domain, we subset the discretized waveforms over conifer forest by finding their intersection with conifer-classified pixels from a species-level classification map derived from the NEON hyperspectral acquisition (Falco 2023). We forced the LayerStacking algorithm with this subset of LiDAR data and the optimal parameter permutation to delineate all tree crowns in the watershed's conifer stands. The result was a spatially continuous dataset of conifer tree objects describing their locations and heights. To estimate the DBH of each delineated object, we estimated coefficients for an allometric function using binned plot observations, following @jucker_allometric_2017. The equation to fit was $\hat{DBH} = exp[\alpha + \beta\ log(H)] \times exp[\sigma^2/2]$, where the H is tree height and $\sigma^2$ is the mean square error of the regression. Per Jucker 2017, the last term is an approximation of theoretical model error $\epsilon$, assuming $\epsilon$ is normally distributed, and is imposed to yield an unbiased prediction of DBH. 

### 2.4.2. Species composition
The tree-crown product was fused with a forest species classification dataset, developed  at 1 m resolution through a support vector machine classifier on 2018 NEON AOP hyperspectral imagery (Falco 2023). From the discretized waveforms, we computed a canopy height model at 0.5 m resolution across the full domain and used this to force a marker-controlled watershed segmentation algorithm, with the identified tree crown objects as controls (Plowright et al. 2023). This procedure produced polygons demarcating the estimated crown perimeters of every crown identified through LayerStacking. Because the passive imaging spectrometer generally received reflectance signals only from light-exposed portions of tree canopies, it was necessary to filter our segmented tree crown objects to match the hyperspectral targets as nearly as possible. Attempting to align species information with mid- and subcanopy objects yielded unacceptably poor agreement. We therefore filtered the LiDAR-detected trees to the canopy top by removing all objects below the 90th percentile height. We performed the filtering independently in each cell of a 100 m grid to account for height variability across the domain. We then overlaid the remaining polygons on the classification raster and assigned each object to a single tree species according to the majority rule, i.e., if 50 percent or more of the pixels intersecting the object were classified to that species (@dalponte_individual_2019). For objects where less than 50 percent of pixels belonged to a single species, we labeled the object "NA." 

### 2.4.3. Forest structure
From the fused product, we computed continuous area-based structural metrics by summarizing object-level predictions at specified grid scales across the watershed (Fig S2). Structural metrics included total number density (TND),stand basal area (BA), quadratic mean diameter (QMD), diameter and height percentiles, and skewness of height, all computed at the level of a grid cell. TND (stems ha^-1^) was a sum of the number of trees over grid cell area for all trees and per species. BA (m^2^ ha^-1^) was computed as: 

$$BA = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}\pi (DBH/2)^2}{grid\ cell\ area}$$ {#eq:eqn2}

QMD (cm) was computed as:

$$QMD = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i}^{n}{DBH^2}}$$ {#eq:eqn3}

where $n$ is the number of trees in the cell. Skewness of height was computed as the third central moment of the distribution of stem heights. Larger positive values signified a more positive skew, with a larger proportion of trees in smaller height classes than a normal distribution. More negative skew values signified a negative skew, with a larger proportion of trees in larger height classes. To further restrict the analysis to intact conifer forest stands (as opposed to isolated trees or mixed forest), we further masked each raster, preserving pixels where conifer total number density was greater than 100 stems ha^-1^ and removing a 100 m buffer around roads, developed areas, and the outer perimeter of the NEON AOP LiDAR acquisition. During processing, we discovered that the waveform returns from four adjacent AOP flightpaths were missing. According to the NEON post-flight report, a hardware failure on June 6, 2018 prevented the waveform digitizer from collecting GPS timing signals, which rendered the waveform data irretrievable (@goulden_post_2020). In early testing we attempted to gap-fill this region by processing the NEON discrete-return point cloud, but ultimately abandoned the effort because of unacceptable anomalies from the higher-fidelity waveform-based estimates. This gap is visible as an empty north-south swath in the forest structure products and is excluded from analysis, along with a 100 m buffer around its perimeter to minimize edge effects.

## 2.5. Abiotic explanatory variables

### 2.5.1. Topography 
We generated six topographic variables from the NEON 1 m DEM (see Table 1 and Fig. S3). We prioritized factors whose variability has been shown to modify the radiation or moisture budget in trees' local growing environments (Frey et al., 2016). Elevation (m) was computed at the 100 m pixel scale by averaging the raw DEM. Slope angle (degrees) and aspect (degrees) were computed from the elevation product with the `terrain` method in the R package `terra` with 8 neighbors, using the method in Horn (1981). We further transformed the aspect product by folding values about the 25ºNE--205ºSW line. This transformation--onto a scale with a maximum on southwest faces and minimum on northeast faces--yields a more ecologically relevant measure of aspect-constrained exposure (@mccune_equations_2002). The fold line we selected represented the estimated angles of highest and lowest mean annual incident radiation in the domain, given the watershed's latitude and slope orientation. Total heat load (unitless index) was calculated from folded aspect and slope angle using the method in @mccune_equations_2002. Topographic position index (TPI) is a morphometric measure that classifies a landscape into slope position classes, from toeslope to ridgetop We computed TPI at each pixel as the difference between the elevation at the target point and the mean elevation within a neighborhood of 9 pixels (1000 m), normalized to the standard deviation of elevation in that window (Gallant and Wilson 2000; @de_reu_application_2013). TPI values are more positive when a target point is higher than its neighborhood, and more negative when the target is lower. Topographic Wetness Index (TWI) ($log(m^2/m)$) is a measure of the relative capacity of an area to accumulate water through surface or subsurface flow. We selected this metric as a proxy for relative soil moisture conditions. We used the implementation in the R package `dynatopmodel`, which calculates TWI as the log ratio between a pixel's upslope contributing area and its own slope angle (Quinn et al. 1995, Metcalfe et al. 2018). 

### 2.5.2. Climate
To estimate relative spatial patterns of snow accumulation (m), we retrieved snow water equivalent (SWE) data produced by Airborne Snow Observatories, Inc (formerly NASA/JPL Airborne Snow Observatory; ASO) from flights on March 31, 2018, April 4, 2019, and April 21, 2022 (@deems_lidar_2013; @painter_airborne_2016; @painter_aso_2018; see also https://data.airbornesnowobservatories.com/). The flights occurred before the onset of snowmelt in each season. The ASO SWE product was generated from observations of snow depth, spectral albedo, and radiative forcing from a coupled imaging spectrometer and terrestrial laser scanning system, combined with snow density modeled using iSnobal (@painter_airborne_2016). We also produced an estimate of the relative velocity of snow disappearance (m day^-1^). In each flight year, we differenced the snow-on values and snow-free values from subsequent flights (May 24, 2018; June 10, 2019; and May 18, 2022, respectively), and divided by the day interval between paired flights. While the ASO data may not have captured peak snow depth or maximum snow-free extent in each season, averaging across three years of flights enabled us to approximate dominant spatial patterns of accumulation and disappearance across the basin.

We also used estimates of annual mean total actual evapotranspiration (AET) and climatic water deficit (CWD) generated by the Basin Characterization Model (BCM) for the Upper Colorado Basin from 1985 to 2012 (Buto et al. 2017). The BCM output package characterizes the water balance for a subject region at 270 m resolution. The model is forced with monthly data and has been widely used in ecological and management applications (Flint et al. 2013). From this dataset, AET is the depth of water (mm) evaporated from the surface or transpired by plants within each pixel. CWD is calculated as the difference between potential evapotranspiration (PET) and AET (mm), where PET is the total depth of water that can be evaporated or transpired given prevailing atmospheric conditions. Under non-limited moisture conditions, AET equals PET and CWD is 0; positive CWD values correspond to moisture deficit, or an excess of atmospheric demand relative to available water in the soil (Buto et al. 2017).

### 2.5.3. Soil
To evaluate edaphic effects on forest structure and composition, continuous estimates of soil properties were derived from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) Soil Survey Geographic Database (SSURGO). (Survey Soil Staff 2022). SSURGO contains geospatial information on soil properties predicted via an ensemble of regression, classification, and machine-learning operations on observations from *in situ* soil samples and environmental predictor variables. Spatial and attribute data were retrieved from the database using the R library `FedData`, using the keys for area symbols that intersect the study domain (CO654, CO660, CO661, CO662). The hierarchical data structure contains polygons demarcating mapping units at 1:12000 scale. Each mapping unit is made up of one to three major components and potentially several minor components. A component is defined as a field-classified soil type with common characteristics. For example, the Evanston component, which appears in our study domain, occurs on side valleys and alluvial fans on slope grades from 5 to 20 percent. Evanston soils are derived from rhyolitic or sandstone alluvium, and organic content tends to be low. While components are not spatially explicit, their proportional contribution to the makeup of a map unit is stated. Further, each component is associated with detailed data from its constituent horizons. 

After joining the spatial and attribute tables, we aggregated horizon-scale data to generate a unique observation per component. For horizons within a given component, we calculated horizon depth--weighted means for available water capacity (AWC, 'awc_r') and hydraulic conductivity (k_sat_, 'k_sat_r') in the top 100 cm of soil. We calculated the horizon depth--weighted mean of percent organic matter (OM, 'om_r') in the top 30 cm of soil. We calculated total soil depth as the maximum horizon depth per component. We took these variables to be independent estimates of soil constraints on tree growth, and the selected soil depths to be those in which the selected variables likely exert the strongest biophysiological effect. Initial testing also included percent sand and clay, pH, and cation exchange capacity. These either had sparse observations across the domain or were highly correlated with one or more of the selected variables and were dropped from modeling. These component-scale estimates were aggregated to the map unit scale, weighting mean values by the proportion of each component represented in a map unit. The spatially referenced data were converted from vector to raster format using the `rasterize` function in the R package `terra`.

### 2.5.4. Geology
The underlying geological substrate was characterized by rasterizing the Colorado Geological Survey vector database "R-37: Geology and Mineral Resources of Gunnison County, Colorado" (Morgan 2020). The vector database had been created through digitization of the original sheets used to prepare the U.S. Geological Survey MI-16 Geologic Map of Colorado (Tweto 1979).

## 2.6. Inferential modeling

We quantified relationships between our spatially continuous stand structural metrics and underlying abiotic factors using generalized additive models (GAM) and generalized boosted models (GBM), fitting separate models for each response variable. All data were first (dis-)aggregated to the 100 m pixel scale and aligned to a uniform grid using bilinear interpolation for continuous variables and nearest-neighbor resampling for categorical variables. Because of expected spatially autocorrelative structure in both response and explanatory variables, we also included a smooth of x and y pixel coordinates in all models. 

In the GAM approach, we estimated each structural metric as the sum of nonlinear spline functions of the explanatory variables, using the `gam` implementation in the R package `mcgv`. The generalized additive approach allowed us to account for nonlinearities and to uncover variable interactions. We examined the main effects of each explanatory variable, along with two-way interactions between a subset of variables (Table S3). In the GBM approach, we predicted stand structure from the abiotic variables using the stochastic gradient boosting framework in R's `caret` and `gbm` libraries. This decision tree-based strategy yielded estimates of total variance explained by each model, as well as the relative influence of predictor variables. Variable influence is estimated by tallying the number of times a variable is selected for splitting and then averaging this value over the ensemble of decision trees weighted by the squared increase in deviance explained at each split and is expressed relative to the other variables in the model.  

We elected to use these two strategies in parallel because of complementary strengths of each. The GAM strategy allows for interpretation of functional shapes through partial dependence and quantifies effects of interactions between variables. While partial-dependence plots can be estimated from the GBM, their interpretability is usually limited, especially when variable interactions exist, and they are often caveated as rough approximations (@friedman_multiple_2003; @elith_working_2008). On the other hand, the GBM allows for numerical comparison of feature importance, which can be difficult to attain with the GAM. We assumed that convergence between modeling strategies would give us greater confidence in the results, while divergence could provide points of departure for further investigation. 

# 3. Results

## 3.1. LiDAR vs. field inventory
Comparing detected trees to the field inventory, the optimal LayerStacking algorithm extracted 4196 trees across the 17 plots (Table 4; see Table S2 for results for each LayerStacking parameter permutation). Of these, 55 percent were successfully matched to field trees. The RMS distance between matched trees was 2.45 m in the horizontal dimension and 1.46 m in the vertical dimension. Agreement between matched trees was strong across all size classes. Underdetection and undermatching were most prevalent in trees below 8 m in height, while some overdetection occurred in trees between 15 m and 20 m in height (Fig. 2).

Of the tree objects detected in training, median height was 8.8 m (s.d. 7.6 m), versus 6.7 m (s.d. 6.9 m) in the field inventory. Maximum canopy height, estimated at the 95th percentile, was more similar, at 24.4 m versus 23.8 m in field inventory. We computed DBH for each detected tree using the fitted equation $\hat{DBH} = exp[-0.1379 + 1.2082\ log(H)] \times exp(0.0105)$, where the third term is $\sigma^2/2$. QMD of detected trees in the plots was 20.4 cm (s.d. 13.7 cm), versus 18.6 cm (s.d. 12.7) directly measured in the field. We disaggregated 95th percentile height and QMD by site to evaluate performance in more detail (Fig. 3).

## 3.3 Domain-wide structure and composition
Applying the optimal LayerStacking algorithm and parameters to conifer forests across the full domain produced $2.375 \times 10^7$ individual trees. Based on underdetection rates among smaller size classes in training, we assumed that the total number was a modest underestimate. We applied a correction to this value by binning plot-level data into 1-m height increments and computing the difference in the frequency of occurrence between field-observed and LiDAR-detected trees per bin. We performed the same binning on detected trees in the full domain and scaled the number of trees per bin by the plot-level frequency differentials (Fig. 4). With this correction, we estimated the total number of conifer trees to be $2.392 \times 10^7$.

Stand density ranged from 100 to 2041 stems ha ^-1^. Density was bimodally distributed, with maxima near 100 and 1600 stems ha ^-1^. When disaggregated by species, the spatial distribution of *P. engelmannii* (spruce) and *A. lasiocarpa* (fir) was similar, though maximum absolute densities differed by a factor of two. Spruce densities ranged from 2 to 336 stems ha^-1^, while fir ranged from 2 to 172 stems ha^-1^ (note that the order of magnitude difference between these values and total density is largely because we only considered top-of-canopy stems when assigning species). *P. contorta* was concentrated almost exclusively on low-elevation slopes near the southern boundary of the domain. 

The median height of all LiDAR-detected trees in the watershed was 4.8 m (s.d. 6.8 m), and 95th percentile height was 21.7 m. Height skewness ranged from -1.8 to 8.8. Allometry-estimated QMD was 17.0 cm. Basal area ranged from 0.03 to 248.8 m^2^ ha^-1^. All of the structure estimates were non-normally distributed, as would be expected in forests of mixed size and age class. Frequency distributions for all gridded forest structure estimates appear in Fig. 4. 

## 3.2 Abiotic factors associated with forest structure
Inferential modeling revealed three distinct patterns of relationship. 
(1) Density was explained primarily by factors connected to snow input and soil water storage.
(2) Maximum canopy height, QMD, and BA were also primarily explained by snow and soil moisture factors, but with elevation as a mediator and with functional relationships inverse of those with density.
(3) Height skew, which describes the balance of larger and smaller size classes in a stand, was poorly correlated with all factors.

Model results for explanatory variables were generally coherent between the two modeling strategies (Table 6). The five most influential variables on each response in GBM were also significant (p < 0.01) in GAM and exerted the most leverage on the responses based on interpretation of partial-effects plots.  <!---(See Table S4 for results for the full set of independent variables: intercept and linear effects coefficients, estimated degrees of freedom, and significance of the splines for GAM; relative importance for GBM).--->

All response variables were strongly associated with SWE and ∆SWE, which broadly described the snow input component of the watershed's climate (Fig. 5). Soil available water content and elevation were also high-influence predictors of stand structure. Density was more strongly associated with geologic substrate than were the other forest structural factors, which were in turn influenced more strongly by soil total depth and soil K, in the case of basal area. Geology was the least important predictor of height, QMD, and BA. Other individual climatic, topographic, or soil factors contributed less than 5 percent to variance reduction in any response. Together, all variables ranking below the top five in Fig. 5 contributed 21.7%--41.4% of cumulative variance reduction in any response.

### 3.2.1 Forest structure and climate
SWE and ∆SWE were the most important predictors of density and were among the top five for all responses. SWE and ∆SWE relationships with all responses were strongly nonlinear: where ∆SWE was highest (suggesting more rapid snow disappearance), height, QMD, and basal area were lowest. Maxima in these measures of forest structure coincided with mean SWE and ∆SWE values (.50 m and 0.0050 m day ^-1^, respectively). The reverse was true for both density and height skew, with denser stands and stands containing smaller-statured trees (high skew) occur in sites where snow accumulation is greatest and also where disappearance is most rapid. The remaining two climate variables, CWD and AET, were among the least important predictors of any structural measure in the GBMs, and the covariance with structure in the GAMs was much less coherent than in SWE and ∆SWE. 

### 3.2.2 Topography 
Elevation exerted an approximately negative-exponential control on stand density across the gradient, but a non-monotonic effect on height, QMD, and basal area (Fig. 6). Maximum density was found at the lowest elevations (~ 2700 m), while maxima in height, QMD, and basal area co-occurred between 3000 m and 3300 m. Minima on these four variables occurred at the highest elevations (3600 m -- 3800 m). Neither modeling strategy found a strong elevational influence on height skew. TPI was the only other topographic factor to emerge as a major predictor, and for height skew only. TPI exerted modest leverage on height skew, and the shape of the relationship suggested that stands with more small trees occurred at lower elevations and stands with more large trees at TPI values around 1.0, coinciding with mid- to upper-slopes. Heat load and slope had minimal effects on any forest structural characteristic. 

### 3.2.3 Soil
Available water content based on soil composition and structure had the greatest leverage on height and BA (Fig. 5). The response in these factors was bimodal, with maxima around 0.10 and 0.18, which were approximately the mean and two standard deviations above the mean. Density, in contrast, increased monotonically with AWC but the relationship was also nonlinear. The total depth of soil showed opposite relationships with height skew (negative) versus with height, QMD, and BA (positive), but the splines were tightly kinked along the support. Soil K and percent organic matter had less interpretable effects in the GAM, with high estimated degrees of freedom on the splines and large amplitudes at low values but little meaningful trend over the splines. Together they accounted for less than 10% of relative variance in any of the GBMs.

### 3.2.4 Geology
Geology emerged as one of the five most important predictors for density but was the least important for height, QMD, and basal area. Density was higher than average on the sand/shale Gothic formation and lower than average on claystone-shale, granodioritic laccoliths, the sand/silt Mesa Verde Formation, and mudstone/conglomerate Maroon Formation (Table 8).  Coefficients on geologic substrates were mostly non-significant in GAM for other structural factors, though basal area was significantly higher on intrusive laccolith parent material and on the claystone-shale Wasatch formation. 

### 3.2.5	Feature interactions
In the GAM strategy, we further two-way interactions between elevation and each of SWE, ∆SWE, AWC, and TPI. Interaction terms were significant across all five GAMs. In Fig. 7, we show interaction plots for elevation and the top predictor for each structural variable. The interactive effects were most pronounced for density and QMD. Highest stand density occurred at the interface of low elevation and rapid snow disappearance, while the lowest densities occurred at high elevations, regardless of melt rate, and where low elevation and slow melt coincided. As for QMD, the girthiest trees in the domain tended to occur where low elevation coincided with high soil AWC. 

# 4. Discussion

We have described an analysis of abiotic correlates with several measures of forest stand structure based on discretization and tree-crown detection of full-waveform LiDAR. The study quantified the relative contribution of climatic, topographic, edaphic, and geologic factors to explaining stand structure, and further described the functional behavior of individual covariates, as well as interactions between explanatory factors. In section 4.1, we discuss the efficacy of the method for estimating stand structural characteristics. Then, in section 4.2, we evaluate the inferential results in the light of prior findings and biophysical processes.

### 4.1 Optimization of tree segmentation on discretized waveform LiDAR is appropriate for continuous estimation of forest structure
Our detection and match rates between field-observed and model-detected trees compared favorably with results from prior studies using the same automated matching procedure. In their benchmarking analysis of eight delineation algorithms, @eysn_benchmark_2015 reported a maximum RMS match rate of 36% and an extraction rate of 55% with 1.6 m ∆Z accuracy and 0.9 m ∆XY accuracy in a mixed-age conifer site, a substantial underdetection bias compared to our results. @pang_nystrom-based_2021 reported a match rate of 70% on an extraction rate of 103% across 10 sites of varying composition. However, their analysis used a minimum diameter threshold of 5 cm and minimum height of 4.2 m, where ours were 1.0 cm and 1.3 m, respectively. @ayrey_layer_2017 reported true-positive rates of 66%--69% and commission rates of 22--29% in their original application of the LayerStacking algorithm in dense uneven-aged conifer forest. In their case, they manually matched trees through visual observation and enforced a minimum DBH threshold of 10 cm. The strength of agreement in our study suggests that it is possible to map height, location, and DBH at the ITC level with sufficient accuracy using the ITD optimization strategy described here. Our results further support @dalponte_tree-centric_2016 's conjecture that tree-centric approaches to quantifying forest characteristics are appropriate, and in some cases even advantageous compared to area-based approaches, because they allow for feature estimation at any (reasonable) spatial scale on fundamentally the same epistemological basis as a field inventory.

On average, the ITD model overestimated the number of trees in plots by 28 percent, largely because of overdetection in the middle height classes of lower density plots and underdetection in the lower height classes across sites. The higher extraction rate in our deployment of the LayerStacking algorithm suggests that we slightly overdetected trees, resulting in a high density bias and, potentially, a low QMD and BA bias, pointing to a need for further refinement of the delineation approach and/or a generalizable correction factor. The model overestimated median height by 1.2 m across plots, but overestimated maximum height by only 0.2 m. Using site-derived allometric coefficients produced a negligible overestimate of QMD (+ 0.3 cm) relative to field data. That we were able to extract and match a large proportion of true subcanopy trees with relatively low commission error underscores the advantage of full waveform over discrete point data @anderson_is_2016. 

One novel contribution of this analysis was our workflow for optimizing tree-crown detection. One of the critical challenges in large-scale tree mapping is justifying the selection of algorithm and optimal parameters for a particular site and vegetation type. We addressed this challenge by bringing to bear an approach with roots in the machine-learning domain. Our method allowed us to robustly train, test, and validate ITD procedures while preserving interpretability of model parameters. By programatically iterating through multiple algorithms and large permuted sets of parameters, we were able to objectively and empirically justify the ITD method applied in domain-wide prediction. We note that other algorithms are available, and others among those we tested may have performed better in other domains, but we suggest that our approach offers a model for reproducible tree detection for the discipline. A further contribution of our method is that it demonstrates the possibility of predicting individual-scale tree attributes over a large domain while training on only a small proportion its trees, provided the training samples are well distributed across environmental and structural gradients.

### 4.2 Abiotic constraints on stand structure

In this watershed-scale analysis, we found factors relating to soil water release (AWC), precipitation input (SWE, ∆SWE), and elevation to predominate as explainers across different measures of stand structure (59.7%--81.1% relative influence in GBM). 

The importance of snow variables, SWE and ∆SWE, is consistent with findings that conifers in this region rely on stored winter precipitation and snowmelt pulses as their primary water source (Berkelhammer et al. 2020; Allen et al. 2019). Again, the relationships for density and for other structural factors were decoupled. Density was low and stable across low-to-median values on the SWE distribution, and increased toward the upper extreme. The other factors showed the opposite trend: high and stable at low-to-median SWE values and decreasing toward the upper extreme.

Because our statistical approaches described covariability, we were limited in our ability to infer causal direction in these relationships. It is likely that forest canopy structure and snow dynamics create amplifying and attenuating feedbacks. Tree and canopy structure modifies snow accumulation and ablation (Jost et al. 2007, Varhola et al. 2010, Schneider et al. 2019). Higher canopy density can increase interception, leading to lower surface accumulation than in adjacent gaps or unforested areas (Martin Dickerson-Lange et al. 2017; Dickerson-Lange et al. 2023; Sun et al. 2023). Intercepted snow can return to the atmosphere via sublimation or deposit on the surface through melt or mass release. Trees also influence snow redistribution by modifying wind patterns and intercepting wind-blown snow (Faria et al. 2000). Tree and stand effects on snow melt dynamics are variable. By shading snow from incoming shortwave radiation, trees can slow snowmelt; but as radiating bodies, they can increase melt rates, especially in the zone of influence surrounding individual tree boles (Lawler and Link 2011). The net effects depend in part on scale (Veatch et al. 2009; Bonner et al. 2022; Lundquist et al. 2013). 

In the other direction, seasonal snowpack also influences tree growth and forest structure. Seasonal snowpack provides a reservoir that exceeds soil saturation and may delay soil drydown well into the growing season (Gleason et al. 2021; Bales et. al 2021). Local canopy influences on melt rate influence the size and duration of this reservoir, in turn modifying the quantity of moisture available to meet summer atmospheric demand. In some regions, particularly those with more arid climates, high peak SWE and longer snowpack duration enhance tree growth (Littell et al. 2008, Hu et al. 2010, Trujillo et al. 2012, Anderegg et al. 2013, Gleason et al. 2021). However, in more energy-limited systems, the opposite effect obtains, largely because of constraints on the growing season (Littell and Peterson 2005, Littell et al. 2008).

The stand density-SWE relationship uncovered in our study suggests that at the hectare-to-watershed scale higher stand density provides a net negative feedback to snowpack duration, such that snow disappears faster in areas of higher density, albeit with a diminishing effect at very high densities. It may also be the case that faster snow disappearance has led to lower-density stand development over the long term. On the other hand, height, QMD, and BA peaked in areas of below-average melt rate, suggesting that snowpack persistence may be advantageous for individual-tree productivity. 

Soil AWC is a measure of the water available to plants per unit depth and is parameterized in the SSURGO data as the difference in volumetric water content at field capacity ($\theta$ = 0.10 bar) and at the permanent wilting point ($\theta$ = 15 bar). The associative trends diverged between AWC and density, on the one hand, and height, QMD, and BA, on the other. Density generally increased with AWC, with kinks in the middle range of AWC values. However, the distribution of other factors along AWC was non-linear, with a maximum plateau in the middle range of AWC values and declines at either extreme. This suggests a potential decoupling of stand-scale and individual-scale dynamics. While the number of trees seems to be able to continue increasing at ever higher levels of soil available water, there may be a preferential zone of soil moisture facilitating carbon assimilation for the individual.

As for topography, the inflection of height, QMD, and BA curves along the elevation gradient corresponded approximately to the dividing line between montane and subalpine zones, at around 3000--3200 m elevation. To a crude approximation, this suggests that there exists a zone of preference supporting maximum height and diameter growth occurring around this elevational range. This may have to do with cold-air pooling, where minimum temperatures are depressed at low elevations, in addition to the familiar adiabatic lapse with elevations, because of downwelling of cool air into regionally low areas. The interactive effect of elevation and ∆SWE's on density suggest that this is a plausible interpretation: density was limited where low elevation and long snow residence time co-occurred. That is to say, it may be the case that where pooling cold air preserved snowpack, it also diminished stand development.

While we attempted to capture the influence of geological substrate on structural pattern, the categorical predictors did not account for many of the major lithologic constraints on tree growth, namely water access. There is evidence that large trees root into decomposing saprolite at the soil-bedrock interface, and can root even deeper into fractured bedrock as deep as 20 m. Where this subsurface reservoir exists, it can provide a substantial subsidy during seasonal and secular dry periods, offering trees an advantage over those without access to such a subsidy ([TODO:CITE]). Moreover, water storage below the soil layer depends heavily on lithologic properties not represented in our simple categorical feature. And other geological properties govern downgradient subsurface flow, which we also did not parameterize in our model. Getting a better grasp on these properties could improve our analysis.

### 4.2.1 Water and energy limitation 

Because AET has been so well correlated with net primary production (negatively, for CWD) (Rosenzweig 1968; Lieth 1975; Fritts 1976; Webb et. al 1983) and CWD with canopy height (Fricker et al. 2019), we expected AET and CWD to have the strongest associations with the five measures of forest structure. We further expected these strong climatic signals to be amplified or modulated by other local topographic and substrate properties, given these factors' importance for ecosystem development at small scales (Delcourt 1982). 

Our results did not accord with these expectations, raising questions about water and energy limitation in this high-elevation forested system. We initially assumed that because our domain spanned a 1300 m elevational gradient above 2700 m, we would see evidence of a water-energy (W-E) thresholding effect. It is generally thought that above the W-E threshold, plant growth should be more sensitive to variability in radiation, since PET rarely exceeds AET, and the growing season is short (Hartl-Meier et al., 2014; Roebroek et al., 2020; Sánchez-Salguero et al., 2017; Stephenson, 1998; van der Maaten-Theunissen et al., 2013). We thought stands on the lower end of our elevation range might be sensitive to factors governing water deficit, but that factors governing the radiation budget (AET, heat load, e.g.) would predominate across the majority of the watershed. 

Instead, soil AWC, SWE, and ∆SWE were the dominant signals across the elevational range. Although several studies have identified discontinuities in tree responses to drought and to temperature across elevation gradients, the estimated elevational threshold is extremely uncertain, reported from 800 m to 3200 m (Hartl-Meier et al., 2014; Salzer et al., 2014; van der Maaten-Theunissen et al., 2013). Pinning the threshold to temperature is also uncertain, ranging at least from 8.4 º C (Dudney et al. 2023) to 30 º C (Gantois 2022). This might lead to the conclusion that despite its high elevation, ours is not an essentially energy-limited system, and variability in snow accumulation, melt rate, and available water dictate the spatial pattern of forest structure more so than variability in radiative factors. However, this conclusion seems unlikely because of prior evidence of strong spring and summer energy limitation in this watershed (Carroll et al. 2020, Chen et al. 2021). 

An alternate interpretation is that the W-E limitation threshold may not map tightly to an elevational or temperature threshold. Rather, in keeping with Stephenson and Urban, water-energy limitation may be more of a function of (potentially asynchronous) patterns of moisture availability and radiative forcing, which could have a more mosaic expression on the landscape than a simple temperature threshold might suggest. This expression could easily be missed using spatially discontinuous plot- or gradient-based observations.

A third interpretation, importantly, acknowledges some uncertainty in the extent to which SWE and ∆SWE act as independent constraints on forest structure, rather than integrators of other topoclimatic drivers. SWE and ∆SWE proxy both winter precipitation input and also net energy balance. The positive correlation between SWE and elevation (R=0.58; Fig. S4) points to the influence of radiation on this value. In our study design, it was not possible to quantitatively disentangle the interactive effects of water and energy balance on SWE and ∆SWE, and it is likely that these factors' influence on forest structure has as much to do with their constraints on growing season as with moisture subsidy.

# Conclusions

This paper, to our knowledge, is the first to evaluate a complement of conifer stand structural characteristics on a spatially continuous basis at the scale of a full watershed, incorporating end-members on abiotic gradients along which forest stands grow.

One upshot of our results is straightforward: that evaluating forest structure and its state-factor covariates using spatially continuous data reveals novel and, to a certain degree, unanticipated inferences about their relationships. It may indeed be the case that plot and transect data miss important dimensions of variability in vegetation and environmental gradients, though it will be important to evaluate this claim in other subalpine mixed-conifer domains to verify that these relationships generalize beyond a single watershed.
